The IBM MobileFirst Studio 8.0 Plug-in for Eclipse is now available in the Eclipse Marketplace!  
Use this plug-in to manage your Cordova projects in the Eclipse development environment.

### Installing and Using IBM MobileFirst Studio 8.0 and THyM plug-ins
To install, you must be running Eclipse Mars or later. In Eclipse go to **Help -> Eclipse Marketplace** and search for IBM MobileFirst Studio and install the 8.0 version. You also need to install Eclipse Thym 2.0.0 through the Eclipse Marketplace.

* Thym will allow you to import, create, and manage your Cordova projects, platforms and plugins. 
* The MobileFirst Studio plug-in exposes the various MobileFirst commands in Eclipse IDE. Specifically, it provides the following commands: Open Server Console, Preview App, Register App, Encrypt App, Pull App, Push App, Update App.

**Prerequisites:**  
Make sure you have the MobileFirst CLI installed, as the Eclipse plug-in is dependent on it to run its commands.  
You also need to have a MobileFirst Server running, either locally in the developer machine or on Bluemix.
