The MobileFirst SDK for Xamarin is now available for MobileFirst Foundation v8! You can download the component from the [Xamarin Component Store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/ibm-worklight).

### Get the goodness of MobileFirst Foundation v8
With this release of the SDK, your Xamarin apps can leverage all the  new features of MobileFirst Foundation v8. To mention a few,  [MobileFirst Foundation as a service on IBM Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation) , improved DevOps support, web interface for all app settings etc. For a full list of new features, visit the [release notes](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.getstart.doc/start/c_what_s_new.html).

### Componentized SDKs
Starting with this release, the Xamarin SDK is componentized into separate libraries for Core, JSON Store and Push. This means Push and JSON Store libraries are optional, leading to reduced footprint of your apps. After adding the Core SDK, add the other SDKs when you start using those features.

### PCL Support for C# SDKs
Starting this release we have introduced Portable Class Library (PCL) support for all our C# SDKs. Xamarin for Android and iOS and the native C# SDK for Windows UWP. The C# API set is now common across Xamarin (for Android and iOS) and Windows UWP. For C# developers this allows code that you write for your mobile apps can be run across Android, iOS and Windows.

Now the V8 MobileFirst server is available on Bluemix as a service called [MobileFirst Foundation](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation).
