At [Interconnect ](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/)this year, the IBM Cloud team and [developerWorks](http://ibm.com/developerworks) are launching a new entry point into our cloud platform.

The **[developerWorks Cloud Architecture Center](https://developer.ibm.com/architecture)** presents Bluemix solutions and other cloud-based solutions for common reference architectures. For example, the [Cloud Architecture for Mobile](https://developer.ibm.com/architecture/mobile) describes in a very clear way the interaction of enterprise applications, API management, and data services, gateways, and points to how these can be components can be implemented and connected together properly, and in a repeatable fashion.

The Cloud Architecture for Mobile includes a detailed explanation of the overall solution, a diagram of the reference standard ([CSCC-Cloud-Architecture-for-Mobile](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Customer-Cloud-Architecture-for-Mobile.pdf) (PDF)), and different solutions within the mobile architecture for more specific patterns like [Mobile Workflow](https://developer.ibm.com/architecture/gallery/useMobileWorkflow).

The architectures and their solutions answer common questions such as:

* I know you have all these services, but how do they fit together?
* Do I want to use infrastructure, like VMs, or services, like Data Store?
* Where do I start?
* Where does my service talk to that other service?
* Where is security handled?

And many solutions feature source code, live demos, automatic deployment, and detailed walk-throughs:

The architectures and solutions in the developerWorks Cloud Architecture Center take lots of different moving parts and show how they fit together, both from a development perspective and a business perspective. The site is a needed entry point into the myriad services, solutions, and infrastructure of IBM's cloud platform, designed to present how these features relate to one another and can be used to solve problems and address practical, high-level business needs.

See more about the developerWorks Cloud Architecture Center in the introductory video, below, and come visit the developerWorks Smartbar in the Solution EXPO at  InterConnect 2016 (February 21-25) to see it (and us!) in person.
