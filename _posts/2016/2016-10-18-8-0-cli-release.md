A new MobileFirst CLI build has been released for MobileFirst Foundation 8.0.  

In this release, in addition to a few important fixes, you can now also build multiple adapters with a single command. If you have a folder containing multiple adapters, use the `mfpev adapter build all` to build all adapters one after the other, and `mfpdev adapter deploy all` to deploy all adapters.

> Learn more about various adapter build and deploy options in the [Creating Java and JavaScript Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/creating-adapters/) tutorial.
