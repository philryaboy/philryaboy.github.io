## Overview
The technical conference is a great place to network, learn, and hopefully have some fun.

If you attend IBM® InterConnect 2016, try MQA in one of the labs or talk to us at one of our pedestals to learn how easy it is to use MQA to get immediate, actionable insights from your mobile users. We have several opportunities, so you can find a convenient time. Here is some additional information about the MQA presence:

* **Session 2445: “Improving Your Mobile App with Actionable Mobile Appstore Feedback.”** Mon, 22-Feb. 1:30 – 2:30 PM and Tue, 23-Feb. 10:00 – 11:00 AM, Mandalay Bay South Lagoon K; Two new pieces of feedback (ratings or comments) are submitted to appstores every second. The most engaging and popular mobile apps appear to have regular updates to address that feedback. Join this session to learn how to examine appstore feedback and what kinds of approaches you can take to improve your mobile app and boost its ratings.

* **Session 5601A: “Get the True Quality Picture Direct from Mobile App Users with MobileFirst Quality Assurance.”** Tue, 23-Feb. 12:00 – 4:00 PM, Mandalay Bay Solution EXPO – dev@InterConnect; This brief (about 15 minutes) dev@InterConnect lab guides you through instrumenting an app with MQA so you can get detailed user information about bugs, crashes, and other feedback. The lab will be repeated as needed throughout the 4 hours and yes, you actually can instrument an app in 15 minutes or less!

* **Lab 5650A: “Building Quality Assurance Into Your Mobile Apps.”** Wed, 24-Feb. 4:00-5:00 PM, conference room 301 of the MGM; This lab contains more detail about integrating MQA into your workflow.
