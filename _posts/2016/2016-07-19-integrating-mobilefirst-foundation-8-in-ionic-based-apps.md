Ionic SDK is a framework built on AngularJS and Apache Cordova that helps you rapidly build hybrid mobile apps using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In this blog post I will walk you through how to create, build, and deploy Ionic v1 apps implemented with MobileFirst Foundation.  If you are an on-premise 8.0 customer or [Mobile Foundation service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation) customer, then read further to learn how to integrate Ionic v1 based apps.
Coming soon: walkthrough for Ionic v2.

## Prerequisites
You will need to install the following tools: MobileFirst CLI, Ionic CLI, Cordova CLI, as well as have a MobileFirst server running.  
Ensure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) downloaded and installed. With NodeJS install you can then install all required CLIs using npm.

To get up &amp; running with the MobileFirst Server you can either use the [Mobile Foundation Bluemix service]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/bluemix/using-mobile-foundation/) or [download the DevKit Installer]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads) for an on-prem installation.

#### Installing the CLIs

**MobileFirst CLI**  

```bash
npm install -g mfpdev-cli
```

> Learn more about the [MobileFirst CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/using-mobilefirst-cli-to-manage-mobilefirst-artifacts/)

**Ionic CLI**  

```bash
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

**Cordova CLI**  

```bash
npm install -g cordova
```

## Creating a New Ionic Project
Create a new Ionic project with a blank template by entering the command below.

```bash
ionic start myApp blank
```

Ionic automatically adds the **Cordova iOS v3.8** plug-in, however MobileFirst Foundation v8.0 support **Cordova iOS v4.0 and above**. To overcome this, remove the iOS platform and re-add it. Change directory into your Ionic project and run:

```bash
ionic platform remove ios
ionic platform add ios@latest
```

If you want to add the android platform, you can add it with:

```bash
ionic platform add android@latest
```

## Adding the MobileFirst Cordova SDK
The MobileFirst Cordova SDK is provided as a set of Cordova plug-ins and can be installed by running:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp
```

You can confirm the installed plug-ins by entering `ionic plugin list`

## Previewing the App
You can preview the app in a number of ways.

### Ionic Preview
To view both iOS and Android platforms using the Ionic CLI:

```bash
ionic serve --lab
```

![ionic-serve]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-07-19-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic-based-apps/serve.png)

This will launch your default browser and will auto-reload if you change any files in the www directory.

### Update Ionic Code

Open the **js/app.js** file.

The module is named **starter**.

```javascript
angular.module('starter', ['ionic'])
```

The **ng-app** directive in the **index.html** file tells angular which code to run on the page.

```html
<body ng-app="starter">
```

To link the view and the model of the app together, **create a controller** in the **app.js** file.

```javascript
	.controller("mainCtrl", function($scope){
	})
```

The `$scope` service allows you to share variables and functions from the controller to the view.

Go back to **index.html**.

Add **ng-controller** to the body tag and include the mainCtrl name. This allows you to use the controller anywhere inside the body tag.

```html
ng-controller="mainCtrl"
```

### Native App Simulator
To preview the app in a native iOS or Android Simulator, you can use the Cordova emulate command:

```bash
cordova emulate
```

The iOS Simulator will only be available if you are working on a machine running OS X.

## Register App on MobileFirst Server
To enable the MobileFirst capabilities such as using the Mobile Browser Simulator to preview the application we need to add some JavaScript code to connect to the MobileFirst Server.

Open **app.js** and enter the following at the bottom:

```javascript
function wlCommonInit() {
    console.log(">> wlCommonInit() ..." );  
    var serverUrl = WL.App.getServerUrl(function(success){
        console.log(success);
    }, function(fail){
        console.log(fail);
    });
    WLAuthorizationManager.obtainAccessToken().then(
        function (accessToken) {
          console.log(">> Success - Connected to MobileFirst Server");          
        },
        function (error) {
          console.log(">> Failed to connect to MobileFirst Server");  
          console.log(error);        
        }
    );
};
```

Register your app with your MobileFirst Server.

```bash
mfpdev app register
```

<br/>
Open your MobileFirst Console and confirm that your app has been registered.

### MobileFirst Preview
To preview the app in a browser or the mobile browser simulator using MobileFirst:

```bash
mfpdev app preview
```

Select the mobile browser simulator option.

## Implementing the MobileFirst Adapter
MobileFirst adapters provide a way to retrieve and manage data for your mobile client app on the server side.

I’m using the [ResourceAdapter](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80/ResourceAdapter) to call a resource API and [PinCodeAdapter](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80/PinCodeAttempts) for security in this example.

You should first **build** and **deploy** them onto your MobileFirst server. Switch into the root folder of each and run the following commands:

```bash
mfpdev adapter build
mfpdev adapter deploy
```

![adapters deployed to the server and appear in the console]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-07-19-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic-based-apps/adapters-in-console.png)

> Learn more [about Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/)

### Security
The URL that gets the balance in the ResourceAdapter is protected by a scope named “accessRestricted”.

`@OAuthSecurity(scope="accessRestricted")`

In the **Security** tab of your registered **app** in the MobileFirst dashboard, select the **New** button under the **Scope-Elements Mapping** section.

Enter **accessRestricted** in the scope element and select **PinCodeAttempts** in the Custom Security Checks section.

### Call your resource adapter
Add the following code to your **mainCtrl controller** to call make the adapter call:

```javascript
  $scope.balance = "";
  $scope.getAdapter = function(){
	var resourceRequest = new WLResourceRequest("/adapters/ResourceAdapter/balance",
                WLResourceRequest.GET
            );
    resourceRequest.send().then(
                  function(response){
                     $scope.balance = response.responseText;
                     $scope.$apply();
                  },
                  function(error){
                      console.log(error);
                  }
              );
  };
```

We have defined the **balance** variable that will hold the value we get back from the adapter call. We have also defined the **getAdapter** variable which is the function where we actually call the adapter and get the balance.

### Updating the view
Add the following code in your **index.html** in the `<ion-content>` elements:

```html
<h3>Check your account balance</h3>
<button ng-click="getAdapter()" class="button button-block button-balanced">Submit</button>

<h3>Balance: {{ balance }}</h3>
```

The **ng-click** directive calls the getAdapter function.  
To display the value of a **$scope** variable in your view, you surround it with double curly brackets

```html
{{ balance }}
```

### Adding the Challenge Handler

Add [ChallengeHandler.js](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/PinCodeCordova/tree/release80/www/js) in your project in the js directory.

Reference the script in **index.html**: `<script src="js/ChallengeHandler.js"></script>`

Call the challenge handler in wlCommonInit to handle the security check.

```javascript
PinCodeChallengeHandler()
```

## Testing the App
Run the app in the simulator using Cordova since we are using OAuth security.

```bash
cordova emulate
```

![ionic-launch]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-07-19-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic-based-apps/launch.png)

Click the **Submit button** to get your balance.  
This will call the PinCode adapter and you will need to enter your authorization.

![ionic-pincode]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-07-19-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic-based-apps/pincode.png)

The default pin code is **1234**. You can update this in the console under the PinCodeAttempts adapter > Security Check. After your code is validated, your balance is shown in the app.
