## Overview
[In my previous blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/19/integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic-based-apps/), I walked you through how to create, build, and deploy Ionic 1 apps implemented with MobileFirst Foundation 8.  If you are an on-premise 8.0 customer or [Mobile Foundation service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation) customer, then read further to learn  how to  integrate with Ionic 2 apps which is quite different than the version 1.

Ionic 2 is based on AngularJS 2 which is being written for ECMAScript 6 however this isn’t actually supported by browsers yet. In the mean time, Ionic 2 uses TypeScript which transpiles ES6 code into ES5 code. This will allow us to make use of all the new ES6 features now and future proof the framework.

## Install MobileFirst CLI and SDKs
You will need to install the **MobileFirst CLI, the Ionic, and Cordova SDKs as well as have an MobileFirst server running**.

Ensure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) downloaded and installed.

### MobileFirst CLI
Install the MobileFirst CLI by entering the following command:

```bash
npm install -g mfpdev-cli
```

### Ionic SDK
To install the Ionic 2 SDK and create Ionic 2 projects, you’ll need to install the latest beta release:

```bash
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

### Cordova SDK
Install the Cordova SDK by entering the following command:

```bash
npm install -g cordova
```

## Create a New Ionic Project
Create a new Ionic 2 project with a blank template by entering the command below.

```bash
ionic start --v2 myApp blank
```

> Once Ionic 2 is out of beta you won't need to include the `--v2` flag in the command.

Change directory into the new app’s directory and add android platform if needed (iOS platform 4.1.1 is added by default).

```bash
ionic platform add android@latest
```

### File Structure
Ionic 2 has a more modular approach as you can see in its file structure. You now have an **src** directory which will be where you spend 90% of your time. In this blog, I will mainly focus on the **app** and **pages** directory in the src folder.

The **app.component.ts** file is the main component of the app. The **app.module.ts** is basically our entire app as a module. We need to declare all of the components that your app uses here. Since this blog isn’t adding any new pages, providers, etc...we won’t need to modify the file.

The app is divided into pages which are in the **src/pages** directory. These are the views for your app and are pushed and popped on and off the stack as needed.

You will notice that there are no javascript files like in Ionic 1. They have been replaced with typescript files which is a superset of Javascript ES6. When your browser runs this code it is transpiled into the javascript version that the browser understands.

Since we will be working with the home page, open the **home.ts** file in your favorite editor which is located in the **src/pages/home** directory.

At the top of the file are the imports for your class. Below that are any “decorators” such as `@Component` or `@Directive`. These decorators just allow you to add some extra information to your class to “decorate” the class.

In the default example, the `@Component` decorator includes a selector and a templateUrl. The selector is used to easily reference the page. You can see how this is used by looking in the home.scss page where you can add styling to just this home page. The templateUrl tells the class which view to use.

Each new page that you create will automatically come with its own TypeScript file that controls how your page will behave, a SASS file (.scss) that controls how your page will look, and an HTML page which will control how it is laid out on the screen.

## Add the MobileFirst Cordova SDK
The MobileFirst Cordova SDK is provided as a Cordova plugin and can be installed by running:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp
```

You can confirm the installed plugins by entering `ionic plugin list`.

![plugin-list]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-10-17-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic2-based-apps/plugin-list.png)

## Preview the App
You can preview the app in a number of ways.

### Ionic Preview
To view both iOS and Android platforms using the Ionic CLI:

```bash
ionic serve --l
```

![ionic-serve]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-10-17-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic2-based-apps/ionic-serve.png)

This will launch your default browser and will auto-reload if you change any files in the www directory.

> Ionic 2 now previews iOS, Android, and Windows Phone with the `--lab` flag.

### Native App Simulator
To preview the app in a native iOS or Android Simulator, you can use the emulate command:

```bash
ionic emulate iOS
```

> The iOS simulator will only be available if you are working on a machine running OS X.

## Register App on MobileFirst Server
To enable the MobileFirst capabilities such as using the Mobile Browser Simulator to preview the application we need to add some javascript code to connect to the MobileFirst Server.

> **Note:** Make sure you have your MobileFirst Server running.

To register the application:

```bash
mfpdev app register
```

Open your MobileFirst console and confirm that your app has been registered.

### MobileFirst Preview
To preview the app in a browser or the mobile browser simulator using MobileFirst:

```bash
mfpdev app preview
```

Select the mobile browser simulator option.

> **Note:** Currently OAuth isn't fully implemented with the Mobile Browser Simulator

## Implement the MobileFirst Adapter
MobileFirst adapters provide a way to retrieve and manage data for your mobile client app on the server side.

I’m using the [ResourceAdapter](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80/ResourceAdapter) to call a resource API and [UserLogin](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80/UserLogin) for security in this example.

You should first **build** and **deploy** them onto your MobileFirst server. Run:

```bash
mfpdev adapter build
```

Followed by:

```bash
mfpdev adapter deploy
```

### Security
The URL that gets the balance in the ResourceAdapter is protected by a security check named **accessRestricted**.

```java
@OAuthSecurity(scope="accessRestricted")
```

In the **Security** tab of your registered **app** in the MobileFirst Operations Console's dashboard, select the **New** button under the **Scope-Elements Mapping** section.

Enter **accessRestricted** in the scope element and select **UserLogin** in the Custom Security Checks section.

### Call your resource adapter
Open the **home.ts** file and add the following code under the import section but before the `@Component` line:

``` javascript
declare var WLResourceRequest;
```

Next, add a `balance` variable above the constructor function. This variable will hold the value we get back from the adapter call.

``` javascript
balance;
```

Finally, add a `getBalance()` function that will make the adapter call.

```javascript
getBalance(){
    var resourceRequest = new WLResourceRequest("/adapters/ResourceAdapter/balance",WLResourceRequest.GET);

    resourceRequest.send().then((response) => {
        this.balance = response.responseText;
        console.log(this.balance);
    },
    function(error){
        console.log(error);
    });
}
```

### Update the view
Add the following code in your **home.html** in the `<ion-content padding>` elements:  

```html
<h2>My balance is : {% raw %}{{ balance }}{% endraw %}</h2>
<p><button ion-button (click)="getBalance()">Get Balance</button></p>
```

* The **click** action calls the `getBalance` function.  
* To display the value of a variable in your view, you surround it with double curly brackets:

```xml
{% raw %}{{ balance }}{% endraw %}
```

### Add the Challenge Handler
When we start the app, we want to go ahead and register the challengeHandler for the securityCheck. We will make these changes in the **app.component.ts** file.

Add a **AuthHandler** variable above the constructor.

```javascript
AuthHandler: any;
```

Add the `AuthInit` function below the constructor function. This will create a **challengeHandler** and call the `DisplayLogin()` function when its called.

```javascript
AuthInit(){
    this.AuthHandler = WL.Client.createSecurityCheckChallengeHandler("UserLogin");
    this.AuthHandler.handleChallenge = ((response) =>{
        this.DisplayLogin();
    });    
}
```

In order to recognize the `WL` variable, we need to declare it under the imports.

```javascript
declare var WL;
```

Under the `AuthInit()` function, add the `DisplayLogin()` function. An alert will be displayed with inputs for a username and password. Because we are using the **UserLogin** security check, as long as the username and password matches each other, it will be allow you access.

```javascript
DisplayLogin(){
    let prompt = this.alertCtrl.create({
    title: 'Login',
    message: "Enter your username and password",
    inputs: [
      {
        name: 'username',
        placeholder: 'Username'
      },
      {
        name: 'password',
        placeholder: 'Password',
        type:'password'
      },
    ],
    buttons: [
      {
        text: 'Login',
        handler: data => {
          console.log('---> Trying to auth with user', data);
          this.AuthHandler.submitChallengeAnswer(data);
        }
      }
    ]
  });
  prompt.present();   
}
```

Since we are using an alert, we need to import the **AlertController** at the top of the file.

```javascript
import { AlertController } from 'ionic-angular';
```

Also add this to the constructor's arguments

```javascript
public alertCtrl: AlertController
```

Since we don't want to create the **challengeHandler** before MobileFirst finishes loading, we need to listen for the `mfpjsloaded` event.

Add the Renderer in the imports:

```javascript
import { Component, Renderer } from '@angular/core';
```

Also add this to the constructor's arguments:

```javascript
public renderer : Renderer
```

Add the listener at the top of the constructor

```javascript
renderer.listenGlobal('document', 'mfpjsloaded', () => {
    this.AuthInit();
})
```

## Test the App
Run the app in the simulator using Cordova since we are using OAuth security.

```bash
ionic emulate
```

![ionic-emulate]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-10-17-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic2-based-apps/ionic-emulate.png)

Click the **Submit button** to get your balance.

This calls the ResourceAdapter and you will need to enter your authorization.

![login]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blog/2016-10-17-integrating-mobilefirst-foundation-8-in-ionic2-based-apps/login.png)

After your username and password is validated, your balance is shown in the app.
