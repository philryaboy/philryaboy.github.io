As of November 25, 2015, this blog post acknowledges that IBM is aware that Cordova announced two CVEs for vulnerabilities on the Android platform. 
This post will focus on CVE-2015-5257. The other CVE is still being worked on. 

> Note: On some sites, this CVE may be referred to as CVE-2015-8320. Red Hat made a typo mistake in their CVE using the same number as Cordova, so Cordova's CVE got pushed to to CVE-2015-8320.

<em>CVE-2015-5257: Weak Randomization of BridgeSecret for Apache Cordova Android

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Cordova Android versions up to 3.6.4

Description:

Cordova uses a bridge that allows the Native Application to communicate with the HTML and Javascript that control the user interface. To protect this bridge on Android, the framework uses a BridgeSecret to protect it from third-party hijacking. However, the BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can be determined in certain scenarios.

Upgreade Path: Developers who are concerned about this issue should rebuild their applications with Cordova Android 4.1.1 or later. Versions after 3.6.4 do not contain this vulnerability.
