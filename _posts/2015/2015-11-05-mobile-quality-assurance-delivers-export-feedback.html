<p>I’ve always been sort of fascinated by the speed and convenience of mail delivery services in the United States. In anticipation of the rapidly-arriving Halloween holiday, I purchased a Harley Quinn costume from Amazon. In a mere two days, my costume of epic proportions was packaged, left the carrier facility, traveled several hundred miles, and delivered to my doorstep. Meanwhile, all I had to do was click a few buttons and walk to my door.</p>

<p>In the latest update of IBM&reg; Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA), we offer a feature with similar speed and convenience: export feedback. With just one click, all of the feedback for your app that is instrumented with MQA is exported to a CSV file and downloaded to your computer. The CSV file includes the following information for each feedback instance:

<ul>
    <li>Timestamp</li>
    <li>Platform identification (iOS or Android)</li>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Logging mode (production or preproduction)</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Feedback message</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For more information about how to use this feature, see "<a href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSJML5_6.0.0/com.ibm.mqa.uau.saas.doc/topics/t_ExportingUserFeedback.html">Exporting user feedback</a>" in the IBM Knowledge Center.</p>

<p>This is no trick! With a few clicks, you can treat yourself by <a href="http://www.ibm.biz/MobileFirstQualityAssuranceTrial">trying MQA on IBM Bluemix&trade;</a>. And you don’t even have to walk to your door.</p>
