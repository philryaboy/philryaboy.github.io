<p>If you have a Worklight Foundation or MobileFirst Platform Foundation application deployed in the Google Play Store, you may soon receive the following warning issued by Google:</p>

<img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/google-play-warning-1024x255.jpg"  />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only a warning; the applications at this time continue to work normally.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In some cases this will <strong>not</strong> be related to Worklight/MobileFirst Platform:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are using the FIPS feature provided by IBM - related to Worklight/MFP</li>
    <li>If you are using the FIPS & JSONStore features provided by IBM - related to Worklight/MFP</li>
    <li>If you are using the JSONStore feature provided by IBM - used OpenSSL is the one supplied by the device OS - be sure the device is patched to the latest version</li>
    <li>If you are using a 3rd party library containing OpenSSL - related to the library; be sure to update your 3rd party libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>In case your are using the FIPS feature and you have received this warning, you only need to update the latest available iFix release for your Worklight/MobileFirst Platform version.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the issue resides only on the client-side. No server change is required.</p>
<p>Once you download the updated Studio/CLI you need to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install the updated Studio plug-in/CLI</li>
    <li>Build your application (don't forget to update the version number in <code>application-descriptor.xml</code>)</li>
    <li>Generate the <code>.apk</code> file</li>
    <li>Upload the updated <code>.apk</code> to the Google Play Store</li>
</ol>

<p>The next time Google Play Store scans apps in their servers, the warning will disappear.</p>
