<p>As you may know, the IBM Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA) team recently released the latest MQA SDKs. If you have not yet used the old or the new version, <a href="http://ibm.biz/MobileFirstQualityAssuranceTrial" target="_blank">try MQA on Bluemix</a>.</p>
<p>The native iOS and Android SDKs remained much the same.  However, the JavaScript hybrid SDK for IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation saw some major changes, and a new Apache Cordova hybrid SDK was born!  For all of you eager developers wanting to learn the latest and greatest changes to this family, continue reading.</p>
<h2>Apache Cordova SDK</h2>
<p>You can use the new Apache Cordova SDK to instrument MQA to work with pure Apache Cordova JavaScript support.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, Apache Cordova is "…a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript. Combined with a UI framework such as jQuery Mobile or Dojo Mobile or Sencha Touch, this allows a smartphone app to be developed with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."[1]</p>
<h2>JavaScript hybrid SDK for IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation</h2>
<p>This SDK replaces the JavaScript SDK for Worklight.  This SDK includes native components for the Android and iOS operating systems in addition to the JavaScript SDK component. This update allows the component to use more of the functions that are provided on the mobile device.</p>
<h2>Enhanced bug reporting</h2>
<p>Another shiny new MQA feature is enhanced bug reporting.  It provides a new interface for reporting bugs and improved capabilities for including graphics in bug reports. Now, your testers can report bugs in a much more informative and understandable way. The updated interface includes fields for reporting the title of the issue, a summary of the problem, what they did when they encountered the problem, and the severity of the issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your testers have more options in regard to screen captures. Instead of being able to take a screen capture of only the current screen, they can also add a picture from their photo gallery or add a new picture by tapping into their phone’s camera. Defect selfies, anyone?</p>
<p>And, to answer your question, yes, all of the SDKs have these enhanced reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>Enjoy all of the new features by updating your current SDKs, or by <a href="http://ibm.biz/MobileFirstQualityAssuranceTrial" target="_blank">trying MQA on Bluemix</a>!</p>
