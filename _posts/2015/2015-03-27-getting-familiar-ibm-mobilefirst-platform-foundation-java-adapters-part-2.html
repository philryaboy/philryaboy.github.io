<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0 introduced a new concept of Java Adapters. Java Adapters are implemented according to JAX-RS specification and allow a wide array of possibilities that were not available before in JavaScript adapters.</p>

<p>This is a second part of the introduction to new Java Adapters provided in IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0. You can watch the first part <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/03/24/getting-familiar-ibm-mobilefirst-platform-foundation-java-adapters/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>The prerequisite for this video is a decent knowledge of MobileFirst adapters framework. You can learn more about it using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/adapter-framework-overview/" target="_blank">this link</a></p>

<p>In this video I’m walking through common patters on using MobileFirst Java Adapters such as<br />
1. Consuming various type of request parameters - query, path and form<br />
2. Supporting various types of http requests - GET, POST<br />
3. Logging and debugging adapter Java code<br />
4. Consuming and producing JSON objects<br />
5. Consuming and producing XML objects<br />
6. Converting JSON to XML and vice-versa<br />
7. Consuming and producing raw data and raw responses<br />
8. Generating QR code using ZXing</p>

<p>As usual – watch it in HD for max resolution.</p>

<p>Important thing to note is that Java adapters are based on the JAX-RS specification and expose a full REST API to the client. In other words Java adapter is a JAX-RS service that can be deployed to MobileFirst Server and that by default, has access to MobileFirst Server APIs. Being a RESTful endpoint they cannot be accessed using WL.Client.invokeProcedure() API which uses an RPC model. Starting with v7.0 the IBM MobileFirst Platform provides a WLResourceRequest class which should be used to access Java adapters. To summarize<br />
1. Java adapters can be only accessed using WLResourceRequest<br />
2. JavaScript adapters can be accessed using WL.Client.invokeProcedure() API<br />
3. JavaScript adapters can be accessed using WLResourceRequest (<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/nl/en-us/SSHS8R_7.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.dev.doc/devref/c_adapters_endpoint.html">read here</a>)</p>
