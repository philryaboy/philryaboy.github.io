This month IBM MobileFirst™ Platform Foundation released two new features in an iFix for Operational Analytics, accessibility, and application crash analytics.


## Crash Analytics
Previously you have had the ability to capture crashes, now with Operational Analytics you can analyze your captured application crashes, thus allowing you to better monitor and troubleshoot your applications. We now offer new charts for monitoring application crashes and charts for application troubleshooting on the dashboard of the Operational Analytics Console.

Crash Analytics has an easy client-side implementation which makes capturing crashes a much simpler task. Rogue crashes are common on apps released to the public. Crash Analytics captures and analyzes rogue crashes and informs the Operational Analytics users. Knowing what causes these rogue crashes gives the developer the opportunity to debug and fix without having to spend the time reproducing the problem. With that being said, Crash Analytics helps your developers save time and betters your app user experience.

## Accessibility
Accessibility features enable people with disabilities, such as restricted mobility and limited vision, to work successfully with IBM MobileFirst™ Platform Foundation.

The IBM MobileFirst Operational Analytics Console now provides accessibility features.
