<p><em><strong>The below is related only to MobileFirst Platform 6.3 and below.</strong></em></p>
<p>In iOS, the application resolution is defined by the launch image provided in the application resources.<br />
MobileFirst Studio creates a default launch image when creating a hybrid application with an iOS environment but it lacks support for iPhone 6/6 Plus resolution. Starting MFP v7.0, support is provided built-in.</p>

<p>In order to support higher resolution, you need to make some adjustments to the Xcode project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add high resolution image files for iPhone 6/6 Plus to the application resources.
    <p>For example:<br />
        Default-667h.png - image for iPhone 6<br />
        Default-736h.png - image for iPhone 6 Plus.<br />
        Default-736h-Landscape.png - image for iPhone 6 Plus in landscape orientation</p>
        <img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/images.png"  /></li>

        <li>Add a <strong>UILaunchImages</strong> property to yourAppName-info.plist in order to add all images items (low and high resolution) as follows:<br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The UILaunchImageName must be named exactly as the added and existing image files.</p>
        <img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/Screen-Shot-2015-03-18-at-17.31.59.png"  /></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>End result:</h3>
