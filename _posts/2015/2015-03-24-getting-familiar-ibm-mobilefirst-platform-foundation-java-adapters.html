<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0 introduced a new concept of Java Adapters. Java Adapters are implemented according to JAX-RS specification and allow a wide array of possibilities that were not available before in JavaScript adapters.</p>

<p>The prerequisite for this video is a decent knowledge of MobileFirst adapters framework. You can learn more about it using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/adapter-framework-overview/" title="This link" target="_blank">this link</a></p>

<p>In this video I'm walking through the most common patters on using MobileFirst Java Adapters such as<br />
1. Creating Java Adapter<br />
2. Understanding Java Adapter structure<br />
3. Implementing simple sayHello procedure for HTTP GET method<br />
4. Implementing several procedures for different HTTP methods<br />
5. Working with various types of request parameters<br />
6. Using Java code to access MobileFirst server functionality and Java servlet functionality<br />
7. Debugging Java Adapters<br />
8. Communicating with a simple backend using using Apache HTTP Client<br />
9. Leveraging WSDL files and communicating with a SOAP based webservice<br />
10. Using WLResourceRequest in client applications to communicate with Java Adapters<br />
11. Using Postman REST client for communicating with Java Adapters</p>

<p>Important thing to note is that Java adapters are based on the JAX-RS specification and expose a full REST API to the client. In other words Java adapter is a JAX-RS service that can be deployed to MobileFirst Server and that by default, has access to MobileFirst Server APIs. Being a RESTful endpoint they cannot be accessed using WL.Client.invokeProcedure() API which uses an RPC model. Starting with v7.0 the IBM MobileFirst Platform provides a WLResourceRequest class which should be used to access Java adapters. To summarize<br />

1. Java adapters can be only accessed using WLResourceRequest<br />
2. JavaScript adapters can be accessed using WL.Client.invokeProcedure() API<br />
3. JavaScript adapters can be accessed using WLResourceRequest (<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/nl/en-us/SSHS8R_7.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.dev.doc/devref/c_adapters_endpoint.html" target="_blank">read here</a>)</p>
