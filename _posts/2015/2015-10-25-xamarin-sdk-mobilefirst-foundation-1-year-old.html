<p>October 8th - the IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation (aka Worklight) <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/view/ibm-worklight" target="_blank">Xamarin SDK</a> turned 1! Agreed – this blog post is a couple of weeks overdue :).  We unveiled the component at <a href="https://blog.xamarin.com/ibm-and-xamarin-partner-to-accelerate-enterprise-mobility/" target="_blank">Evolve last year</a> and have been releasing updates to keep pace with the IBM MFP releases. Initially the updates were a bit slow to keep pace as we were getting the skids greased, but now we are at a 1st day support cycle since our 7.1 release. And we refreshed it 7 times in between as well. 9 updates in the last 12 months – not too shabby! This was a path breaking SDK for the IBM Xamarin relationship as this was the first kid off the block. In May this year the support was broadened to include <a href="https://blog.xamarin.com/ibm-and-xamarin-partner-to-simplify-secure-enterprise-mobility/" target="_blank">IBM MobileFirst Protect</a> (aka Fibrelink Maas360) support for Xamarin built apps.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://strongloop.com/strongblog/ibm-acquires-strongloop-to-extend-enterprise-reach-using-ibm-cloud/" target="_blank">IBM acquired StrongLoop</a> – and that came with a <a href="https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-sdk-xamarin" target="_blank">Xamarin SDK</a> already in the toolbox!</p>
<p>Now IBM MobileFirst Platform is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/08/14/ibm-mobilefirst-platform-server-bluemix-net-5-minutes/" target="_blank">available as a docker image</a> on the IBM Cloud - Bluemix. Xamarin developers can build beautiful apps with the backing of an industrial strength mobile backend service hosted in the cloud: this is developer heaven!</p>
<p>It's been a party supporting the Xamarin and IBM MobileFirst developer community. We have been actively getting developer feedback and then rolling it in in the subsequent release to make them happier. PCL support is in our roadmap, so is Windows support and a lot more. If you really want something in the SDK tell us. Warning! You just might get it!</p>
