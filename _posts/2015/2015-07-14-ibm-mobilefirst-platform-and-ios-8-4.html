All the flagship features such as JSONStore, authentication, notifications, app management capabilities, server connectivity and adapter invocation/chaining, Cordova plug-ins, common UI controls, native pages, native elements in hybrid pages, Analytics and logging all work as expected.</p>

<p>Advanced device security functionalities like App Authenticity, Device Provisioning and others works as expected as well. All IBM MobileFirst Platforms v6.2, v6.3 and v7.0 work as expected.</p>
