Consumers are quick to adopt the newest devices and operating system, and the expectation is that their existing apps continue to work seamlessly after the upgrade. This means organizations delivering mobile apps for iOS must move quickly to test, build, and deliver their apps for the new platform and devices. Considering the heightened expectations and tight timeline, this can be a daunting task for organizations. That said, organizations using the IBM MobileFirst Platform to build, deliver, and manage mobile apps can rest assured that IBM has you covered. We have been busy testing MobileFirst Platform Foundation-based mobile apps on the newest Apple devices and iOS platform, and we have good news!</p>
