<p>Although your app will work with Bluemix without any further updates, there are some ways that the iOS 9 update might affect the functionality of your app.  Review the following information if you haven’t already:</p>
<ul>
    <strong>Transport security:</strong> Because of the new app transport security feature in iOS 9, you might see new permission and security behaviors.  You can find more information regarding these changes and possible configurations for app transport security in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/?cm_mc_uid=07998743765214248868379&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1442426628">iOS: App transport security technote.</a></p>
<p>    <strong>Facebook authentication:</strong> If you are using Facebook authentication in your app, review the information and instructions for iOS 9 on the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/ios9">Facebook developers site.</a></p>
<p>    <strong>Swift 2.0:</strong> Our samples were updated to use the latest updates in Swift syntax.  For more information about Swift 2.0, see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/?cm_mc_uid=07998743765214248868379&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1442426628">Swift website.</a></ul>
