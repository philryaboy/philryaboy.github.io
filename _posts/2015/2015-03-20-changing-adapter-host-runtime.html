<p>HTTP adapters are a great way to connect your application to a backend system. You can set the hostname and port in the XML file and get started quickly.</p>
<p>However sometimes, your hostname is not "set in stone". Maybe you work with a staging server and a production server, maybe you have a list of alternate servers, or maybe your customers can choose the source from a list?</p>

<p>With MobileFirst Platform 7.0 and Java Adapters, this scenario is much easier to accomplish.</p>

<p>In this article, I will extend the RSS Reader built in the tutorial for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/java-adapter/java-http-adapter/" title="Java HTTP Adapter">Java HTTP Adapter</a> to allow the user to choose the news source from a dropdown.</p>

<blockquote>Requirements: IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0 or above, knowledge of Java and Javascript development, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/java-adapter/" title="NEW: Java Adapter" target="_blank">Java Adapter</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/java-adapter/java-http-adapter/" title="Java HTTP Adapter" target="_blank">Java HTTP Adapter</a>.</blockquote>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>With JavaScript adapters, the connection policy (HTTP, SQL, etc) was set in the adapter's XML file and could not be altered without a new deployment. With Java adapter, there is no connection policy. Your custom Java code has free rein over the connection.</p>

<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>I started with the sample attached to the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/server-side-development/java-adapter/java-http-adapter/" title="Java HTTP Adapter">Java HTTP Adapter</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>This sample features a Hybrid application to read a CNN RSS feed. The feed comes from a Java adapter.
The application has a dropdown to choose a topic from the CNN site.</p>
<p>This sample will be adapted to replace the concept of "topic" by one of "host".</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
{% highlight java linenos %}
	private static CloseableHttpClient client;
	private static HashMap<String, HttpHost> hosts;
	private static HashMap<String, String> paths;
	public static void init() {
		client = HttpClients.createDefault();
		hosts = new HashMap<String, HttpHost>();
		hosts.put("cnn", new HttpHost("rss.cnn.com"));
		hosts.put("engadget", new HttpHost("www.engadget.com"));
		paths = new HashMap<String, String>();
		paths.put("cnn", "/rss/edition.rss");
		paths.put("engadget", "/rss.xml");
	}
{% endhighlight %}

As with the original sample, I've set the HTTP Client and the HTTP Hosts as <strong>static</strong> properties. The difference is instead of having one <code>HttpHost</code>, I have two <code>HashMap</code> of hosts and paths.</p>

<p>Both are initialized in the static <code>init()</code> method of <strong>RSSAdapterResource.java</strong>, which gets called by the <code>init()</code> method of <strong>RSSAdapterApplication.java</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>If your application can connect to a longer list of backends, you could set this list in an array instead of a list of variables.</blockquote>

<h3>execute</h3>
{% highlight java linenos %}
	public void execute(HttpUriRequest req, HttpServletResponse resultResponse, HttpHost host)
			throws ClientProtocolException, IOException,
			IllegalStateException, SAXException {
		HttpResponse RSSResponse = client.execute(host, req);
		ServletOutputStream os = resultResponse.getOutputStream();
		if (RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.SC_OK){
			resultResponse.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
			String json = XML.toJson(RSSResponse.getEntity().getContent());
			os.write(json.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF-8")));
	}else{
			resultResponse.setStatus(RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
			RSSResponse.getEntity().getContent().close();
			os.write(RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getReasonPhrase().getBytes());
		}
		os.flush();
		os.close();
	}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As with the original sample, the <code>execute()</code> method is responsible for retrieving the RSS feed.
The difference here is I pass a <code>HttpHost</code> since it will be different for each request.</p>

<h3>GET procedure</h3>
{% highlight java linenos %}
	@GET
	@Produces("application/json")
	public void get(@Context HttpServletResponse response, @QueryParam("host") String hostKeyword)
			throws ClientProtocolException, IOException, IllegalStateException, SAXException {
		if(hostKeyword!=null && hosts.containsKey(hostKeyword) && paths.containsKey(hostKeyword)){
			execute(new HttpGet(paths.get(hostKeyword)), response, hosts.get(hostKeyword));
		}
		else{
			response.setStatus(404);
			response.flushBuffer();
		}
	}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This JAX-RS method is the only public endpoint of the adapter. It can be reached via a <code>GET</code> call to <strong>/IMFMultiHostAdapter/adapters/RSSAdapter</strong>.</p>

<p>It receives a query parameter <code>host</code> which in our example can either be "cnn" or "engadget". The methods retrieves the HttpHost and the path from the HashMaps, and calls the execute method.</p>

<h3>Client-side code</h3>
<h4>index.html</h4>
<p>I took the existing index.html from the original sample and changed the dropdown to show a list of RSS sources instead of topics.</p>
{% highlight html linenos %}
<select id="host" style="width:90%; height:3em;">
	<option value="engadget" selected="selected">Engadget</option>
	<option value="cnn">CNN</option>
</select>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>id</code> was changed to <code>host</code> as well, be careful to update any reference to it.</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<p>This file is almost the same as the original sample. The variable topic was changed to host, and it is initialized to <code>var host = "engadget";</code> instead of keeping it empty.</p>
