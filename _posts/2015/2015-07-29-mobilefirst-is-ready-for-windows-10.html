<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/07/02/windows-10-preparing-to-upgrade-one-billion-devices/">Millions of desktops and laptops</a> around the world have started receiving their upgrade to Windows 10. Ever since we <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/03/23/ibm-mobilefirst-windows-10/">wrote about our experience with the preview builds of Windows 10 in March</a>, we have been testing out more and more features of MobileFirst on Windows 10. Recently, we did a full round of validation on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">RTM build of Windows 10</a> on MobileFirst Platform v6.3 and MobileFirst Platform v7.0.</p>

<h3>Running MobileFirst apps on Windows 10</h3>
<p>The hybrid and native apps that you have developed on MobileFirst 6.3 or MobileFirst 7.0 for the Windows Desktop will continue to run on Windows 10.</p>

<p>MobileFirst features such as server connectivity, application management, push notifications, JSON Store have been validated with Windows 10. Advanced features such as application authenticity (on MFP 7.0 hybrid Windows Desktop apps) have been tested too.</p>

<h3>Windows 10 as a development environment</h3>
<p>In addition to testing MobileFirst applications on Windows 10, we have also been using our Lenovo X220 running Windows 10 as a developer's laptop for both Hybrid and native applications. MobileFirst Studio v6.3 and 7.0 both work well on Windows 10. We have also been using Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 and the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2015-vs.aspx">newly released Visual Studio 2015</a> to compile MobileFirst apps and run them on Windows 10.</p>

<p>MobileFirst is ready for Windows 10!<br />
If you have any comments or questions about running MobileFirst on Windows 10, feel free to add them in the comments below.</p>
<p><em>Note: Windows Desktop apps are built in IBM MobileFirst using the "Windows 8 environment" for hybrid apps and the "Windows 8 Native API" for native C# apps.</em></p>
