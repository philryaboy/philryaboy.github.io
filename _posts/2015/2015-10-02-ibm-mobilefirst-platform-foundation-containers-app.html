<p>Have you tried deploying the MobileFirst Platform to IBM Containers before? If yes, you would have used a bunch of command-line shell scripts which needs a list of prerequisites to set up the environment, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.1/ibm-containers/run"> refer the article - Run IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers</a>.</p>

<p>If you wonder "why not a web user interface for performing the customization, build and deployment of the MobileFirst Image to Containers?", here is the Bluemix application that offers a wizard based web interface that helps you customize, build and deploy IBM MobileFirst project artifacts to Containers on IBM Bluemix.</p>
