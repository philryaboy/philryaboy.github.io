<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation v7.1 introduces support for creating Cordova applications using the MobileFirst Command Line Interface (CLI).<br />
In this type of application, the MobileFirst SDK is packaged into a Cordova plug-in and is served as such along-side other core Cordova plug-ins and 3rd party Cordova plug-ins.</p>

<p>Read more about how to use the MobileFirst CLI and create Cordova applications in the following tutorials:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/7.1/advanced-client-side-development/using-cli-to-create-build-and-manage-mobilefirst-project-artifacts/">Using CLI to create, build, and manage MobileFirst project artifacts</a></li>

</ul>

<p>By now I am sure several light bulbs have popped up above your head, and you're thinking about integrating various Cordova plug-ins into your Hybrid application, allowing you to enhance and modularize your application using Cordova plug-ins and hooks. This was never an easy task to accomplish in past time, made much easier now.</p>

<p>Note though that in order to accomplish this you must convert your existing Hybrid application to a Cordova application.<br />
In the following video I am demonstrating how to accomplish this, using a simple MobileFirst Hybrid application.</p>

<blockquote>Note: Currently only the iOS and Android platforms are supported.</blockquote>

    </div>
</div>

<br>
<p>And voila, a new Cordova application is born.<br />
As mentioned, this was a simple application taken and converted; more complex applications might need additional work based on their specific flow, but for the most part and most apps this should do.</p>

<p>You can also find written instructions in the following user documentation topic: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_7.1.0/com.ibm.worklight.dev.doc/dev/t_migrating_cordova_project.html">Converting existing MobileFirst hybrid app into a Cordova app</a>.</p>

<p>Happy converting!</p>
