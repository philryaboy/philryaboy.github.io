<p>New in IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1 are several Hardened security features.<br />
One of these features is Certificate Pinning.</p>

<p>In the following video I begin by explaining the very basics of secure communication and one of its pitfalls, and how it can be addressed by using Certificate Pinning. The sample application used in the video can be downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/IdanAdar/CertificatePinningProject</p>
