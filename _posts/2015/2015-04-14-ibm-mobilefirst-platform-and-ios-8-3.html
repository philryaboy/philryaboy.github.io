<p>iOS 8.3 is out in the open and things look good for IBM MobileFirst Platform customers and developers.</p>
<p>All the major features such as authentication, JSONStore, App management capabilities, server connectivity and adapter invocation/chaining, notifications, Cordova plug-ins, native pages, common UI controls, native elements in hybrid pages, Analytics and logging all work great.</p>
<p>Advanced device security features like App Authenticity, Device Provisioning and others works as expected.</p>
<p>All the features of IBM MobileFirst Platforms v6.0, v6.1, v6.2, v6.3 and v7.0 all work as expected.</p>
<p>Watch this space as we continue to test all MFP service releases and publish the useful information related to iOS 8.3 here in this blog space.</p>
