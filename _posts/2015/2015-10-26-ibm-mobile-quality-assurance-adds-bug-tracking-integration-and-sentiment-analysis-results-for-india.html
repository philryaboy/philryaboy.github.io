<p>One of the nice things about new features is that they can provide you with the solution to the one or two things that prevented something from completely meeting your needs. For example, do you remember what convinced you to purchase your new phone or car?</p>
<p>Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA) for Bluemix updated its code to include the ability to connect with additional issue-tracking systems, as well as sentiment analysis support for India. </p>
<h3>Bug-tracking system support</h3>
<p>MQA had issue-tracking integration with IBM Rational Team Concert for quite a while, but you had some roadblocks to overcome if you did not use Rational Team Concert. To help overcome these roadblocks, MQA has added support for the following systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>JIRA</li>
<li>TFS</li>
<li>HP Quality Center</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>FogBugz</li>
</ul>
<p>You can integrate MQA with existing accounts that you have established with one or more of these products to send information about bugs, crashes, and feedback. This can simplify your testing workflow if you use MQA and consolidate your test information in one of these systems. For more information about this feature, see "<a href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSJML5_6.0.0/com.ibm.mqa.uau.saas.doc/topics/t_other_integration.html">Integrating with other bug tracking products</a>" in the IBM Knowledge Center.</p>
<h3>India sentiment analysis support</h3>
<p>India is now included as a choice when you enable sentiment analysis for your app.  You can select the IN flag to search the responses in the India Apple store. It is a little bit different when searching the Google Play store. Selecting the IN flag will search for the results in the Hindi locale. You can often get more complete results if you also search for results for the same app in the US (English) locale.</p>
<p>Hopefully these new updates will be the features that convince you that it is time to treat yourself to that shiny new MQA service. Feel free to <a href="http://ibm.biz/MobileFirstQualityAssuranceTrial">take MQA for a test drive on Bluemix</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further posts by <a href="mailto:cdawson@us.ibm.com">Chris Dawson</a> and the IBM MQA team.</p>
