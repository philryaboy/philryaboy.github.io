<p>Apple opened the doors to iOS 8.2 to everyone along with the much anticipated Apple Watch companion SDK.<br />
This is another milestone iOS release and things look good for IBM Mobile First Platform customers and developers.</p>
<p>The latest available version of IBM MobileFirst Platform, v6.3, plays well with iOS 8.2, as well as with the beta releases of iOS 8.3</p>
<p>Major features such as server connectivity  and adapter invocation/chaining,  authentication,  notifications, Cordova plug-ins, native pages, JSONStore, App management functionality, common UI controls, native elements in hybrid pages, Analytics and logging all work great.<br />
