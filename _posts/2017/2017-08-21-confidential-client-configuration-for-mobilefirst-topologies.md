Confidential clients are clients that are capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their authentication credentials. You can use the Mobile Foundation authorization server to grant confidential clients access to protected resources in accordance with the OAuth specification. This feature allows you to grant access to your resources to non-mobile clients, such as performance-testing applications, and any other kind of back-end that might need to request a protected resource, or use one of the Mobile Foundation REST APIs, such as the REST API for **push notifications**. Confidential clients are available with [Mobile Foundation Service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation/) and [IBM MobileFoundation 8.0 on-premise](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/) installation.

### Configure Confidential Clients

For Mobile Foundation 8.0 DevKit, there are three predefined confidential clients, namely ***admin, push*** and ***test***, that comes pre-deployed with Mobile Foundation. The confidential clients with client id ***admin*** and ***push*** is internal to Mobile Foundation and it's required for notification service to work. If these client ids are not available, then you will not be able to register an app with push service from MobileFirst Operation Console and will not be able to send any push notification from Operations Console. Note that with Mobile Foundation Service or with Mobile Foundation on-prem, when an app is registered with it, the app will automatically get registered with Push service. If there is some issue with registering confidential clients, ***admin*** and ***push***, then the app will not be getting registered with Push. The ***test*** confidential clients comes only with Mobile Foundation 8.0 DevKit and not with Mobile Foundation Service and Mobile Foundation 8.0 on-prem production setup.

For Mobile Foundation 8.0 on-prem production setup, when you use either Server Configuration Tool(SCT) or Ant tasks for creating the profile, you have an option to either install the push service or not. 

***Note that only if you select the option to install Push service, the default confidential clients, admin and push, will be available in MobileFirst Server.*** 

When SCT is used to create a profile, you have an option to change the push and authorization url instead of using the default push and authorization server url. There is no option for you to rename the default predefined confidential clients. 

When intall Ant task is used to create a profile, you have the option to change the defaut push and authroization server url as well options to rename and change the client name and credential of the predefined confidential clients.

***Note: The confidential clients ids should be unique across Administration Service and Push Service.***

### How does confidential clients get registered with Mobile Foundation

 If you have installed Mobile Foundation 8.0 DevKit or have created a on-prem production setup with SCT or Ant tasks, with Push service enabled, then you can find the confidential clients JNDI properties in the server.xml. For Cluster Setup (WAS ND), the confidential client JNDI properties can be found via the WAS console 

```xml
    <!-- Declare the JNDI properties for the MobileFirst Administration Service. -->
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.admin.push.url" value='"http://localhost:${default.http.port}/imfpush"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.admin.authorization.server.url" value='"http://localhost:${default.http.port}/mfp"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.push.authorization.client.id" value='"push"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.push.authorization.client.secret" value='"hsup"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.admin.authorization.client.id" value='"admin"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.admin.authorization.client.secret" value='"nimda"'/>

    <!-- Declare the JNDI properties for the MobileFirst Push. -->
    <jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.authorization.server.url" value='"http://localhost:${default.http.port}/mfp/api"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.authorization.client.id" value='"push"'/>
    <jndiEntry jndiName="imfpush/mfp.push.authorization.client.secret" value='"hsup"'/>

```

For Mobile Foundation Service, the confidential client JNDI properties are automatically created during the Mobile Foundation Service creation.

During startup, Mobile Foundation reads these JNDI properties and deploys the confidential clients. Subsequent restarts will check if the confidential clients id and passwords are different from that of deployed ones, if yes, then it redeploys the confidential clients with new values. If you want to change the default confidential clients properties after you have setup a production server or on-prem devkit, you can modify above JNDI properties values. If you are changing the confidential client values, make sure that the values for ***mfp.push.authorization.client.id*** and ***mfp.push.authorization.client.secret*** be same for both Adminstration Service and Push Service, otherwise push operations, eg: sending notifications etc, from Mobile Foundation Operations Console will not work. For WAS ND, you need to change the values via WAS console. The changes made will take effect only after the restart of the Mobile Foundation 

Apart from the pre-built confidential clients, you can add any number of confidential clients to allow a non-mobile client access the resoruces from Mobile Foundation Operations Console.

For on-prem Mobile Foundation, If you are getting an error similar to the one shown below, then most common reasons for this is that the above JNDI properties are not defined or the values of the above JNDI properties are incorrect, especially the ***mfp.admin.authorization.server.url*** and ***mfp.push.authorization.server.url*** properties, though the values for them looks the same, there is a difference in the url value, where ***mfp.push.authorization.server.url*** has an ***api*** at the end. These errors are not usually encounted in Mobile Foundation Service as the confidentials clients are automatically created during the mobile foundation service creation.

If you encounter the issue that is shown in the image above, there is a good chance that you can also see an exception similiar to this :

```
[8/16/17 10:00:54:696 IST] 0000023e com.ibm.mfp.admin.util.PushServiceUtil     E Unable to obtain OAuth Token for Push 
java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.ibm.mfp.admin.util.PushServiceUtil.getOAuthToken(PushServiceUtil.java:1396)
at com.ibm.mfp.admin.util.PushServiceUtil.injectOAuthToken(PushServiceUtil.java:1447)
at com.ibm.mfp.admin.util.PushServiceUtil.getPushHealthStatus(PushServiceUtil.java:224)
at com.ibm.mfp.admin.services.v2.DiagnosticService.getDiagnostic(DiagnosticService.java:271)
at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor351.invoke(Unknown Source)

```

All these errors and exception indicate that the JNDI properties that are mentioned earlier are not configured properly or confidential clients are not registred with LDAP.

### Configure Confidential Clients to work with LDAP

For Mobile Foundation on-prem, you can configure Mobile Foundation administration security to enable connecting to an external LDAP repository. When the LDAP repository configuration is enabled, you must add the confidential client ids to LDAP registry. If the confidential clients are not registered with LDAP, then either you will not see the confidential clients registered with Mobile Foundation server or you will get the same error that was shown in the image above. Confidential client ids should be unique and that unique client id should be added to the LDAP registery.
