**For Application Center on “Liberty for java Runtime” following are the high level steps**


1. Setup your host computer with the required tools ([Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)).
2. Setup your [Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net) account.
3. Build the MobileFirst Application Center and push it to Bluemix as a Cloud Foundry application.

Finally, you will upload the apps to the Application Center and can install the same from devices.


**For Application Center on “IBM Containers” following are the high level steps**


1. Setup your host computer with the required tools (Cloud Foundry CLI, Docker, and IBM Containers Extension (cf ic) Plug-in).
2. Setup your Bluemix account.
3. Build a MobileFirst Application Server image and push it to the Bluemix repository.

Finally, you will run the image on IBM Containers as a single Container or a Container group, and upload the apps to the Application Center.
