On the day of the first total solar eclipse to sweep across the US in 99 years, Google released the next version of their Android operating system 'Android Oreo'. Over the air (OTA) updates of Android Oreo are now available for download on select Pixel and Nexus devices. [See if your device is listed](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/o/download.html).

Android Oreo has introduced a variety of new [features and capabilities](http://www.androidauthority.com/android-8-0-review-758783/) such as notification channels and notification dots for managing push notifications, Picture-in-Picture mode and autofill framework for managing user input. Behind the scenes, Android Oreo also introduces changes to limits on background operations and background location tracking.

### What does it mean for MobileFirst apps?

If you are an on-premise 7.1 or 8.0 customer or [Mobile Foundation Service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation/) customer, then read further to learn about  Mobile Foundation support for Android Oreo .

In general, both native and hybrid/Cordova apps built with IBM MobileFirst v7.1 and 8.0 work well with Android Oreo.


In our [earlier blog post from March 2017](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2017/07/03/mobilefirst-android-o/), we had documented our experience with the developer previews of Android O. Also with the release version of Android Oreo,
we have verified all of the features of MobileFirst Platform Foundation.

Here is a list of features of MobileFirst Platform Foundation that were verified for compatibility with Android Oreo.

* Invoking backend procedures through adapters
* Application Authenticity
* Application management
* Direct Update
* JSON Store
* Unified Push notifications
* Operational Analytics

Our tests have also ensured that native Android apps as well as hybrid/Cordova apps, built on older versions of Android, work perfectly on Android Oreo when a device is upgraded through an OTA. We have also ensured the integrity of apps on devices that upgrade from Android N to Android O.

### Known Issues
There are no known outstanding issues with Android O - so with the latest iFix levels of MobileFirst 7.1 and 8.0, you should be ready to roll.

How has your experience with Android Oreo been? Anything that you liked in particular? Feel free to chime in with your comments.
