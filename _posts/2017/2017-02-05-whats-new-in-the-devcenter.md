Hey all! We'd like to give you a quick update on what has changed and added to the Developer Center in the recent weeks.  

#### Look &amp; feel
As you might have noticed, we gave our landing page a fresh coat of paint and included an overview of Mobilefirst Foundation and it's benefits. And you can check out our features page to read more about what you can do with the product.

In addition, the navigation sidebar in the documentation section is now more visually pleasing.

#### Product documentation
And speaking of product documentation, a few months ago [we've announced]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/10/05/whats-new-in-the-developer-center/) that the full product documentation (for MobileFirst Foundation 8.0) is offered [right here]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/all-tutorials) And now you can also find our  [API reference]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/api) here!

**Coming soon**, translated editions of the product documentation will go live in Japanese, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Korean and more to come.
