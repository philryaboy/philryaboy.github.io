### Introduction

**Progressive web apps** - this is a term that we hear more often in recent times. What is a Progressive Web Apps or PWA in short ?

* Is it a new type of mobile apps ? *No.*
* Is it an app or website built using a new framework ? *No.*
* Is it a new industry standard or technology ? *No.*

Progressive Web Apps is a new approach of developing web apps using existing technologies, making use of existing standards such as HTML5 and browser capabilities to make web apps more user friendly in a multi-channel (desktop, tablet, mobile) world.

More specifically, progressive web apps are required to be:

1. **Responsive** - adapt the UI to different form factors such as desktop, tablet, & mobile.
2. **Fast** - load faster than a normal web app by loading cached web resources.
3. **Network resilient** - PWAs should load atleast the home page when the device is offline and be resilient to network conditions by caching data when it is available.

The above list provides a picture of how PWAs are different from a traditional web app. The list is by no means a comprehensive one, however, you can see the [complete checklist for PWAs here](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist).

### Your own PWA with IBM Bluemix and Mobile Foundation

In the following video, you will see how to host a mobile web app using the [SDK for Node.js on IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/sdk-for-nodejs?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps). The Node.js app itself will host the web content and will integrate with a [Mobile Foundation service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation) for security, backend connectivity and user management.

At the heart of a PWA is the concept of a service worker. In this video, you'll also see how to add a service worker to your web app and how the service worker will equip your web app with offline capabilities.

You can use this video as a starting point and build your web application to include more progressive web app features. [Download the complete source code of the project demonstrated here](https://ibm.box.com/v/PWAwithMFP).
