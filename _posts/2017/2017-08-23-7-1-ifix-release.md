> **Note:** Certain app scan reports indicate a vulnerability in MobileFirst 7.1 apps. The vulnerability is due to the version of Cordova. The publicly available version **Cordova 3.9.2** has this vulnerability. However, the version that is shipped with MFP and which is part of hybrid apps generated by MFP Studio/CLI, has the vulnerability patched.
Therefore, treat the app scan reports for this vulnerability *(CVE-2015-5207)* in *MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1 iFix 7.1.0.0-MFPF-IF201708211241* and above, as a false positive.
