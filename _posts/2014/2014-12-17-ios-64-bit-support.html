<blockquote><p>iOS 64 bit support is now available in IBM Worklight Foundation 6.0 to 6.2 service releases as well as MobileFirst Platform Foundation 6.3.

<p><strong>Original post - November 17th, 2014:</strong><br />
Apple recently announced that starting February 1, 2015 all new iOS apps uploaded to the app store must include 64-bit support. This announcement affects Worklight customers who intend to build apps to be uploaded to the apple app store.</p>
<p>Announcement - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10202014a">https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10202014a</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Starting February 1, 2015, new iOS apps uploaded to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8.1 SDK, included in Xcode 6.1 or later. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code.</p></blockquote>
<p>IBM has already <a href="http://www01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684538">released Worklight iFixes</a> to support iOS SDK 8.1. The IBM Worklight Platform has support to build native 64 bit iOS apps from version 6.2 onwards.<br />
For customers building 64 bit hybrid apps with Worklight versions 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, IBM intends to provide fixes. This blog will be updated with the details once the fixes become available.</p>
<p>Actions required based on the versions currently being used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worklight v6.0, 6.1, 6.2 - Fixes needs to applied once it becomes available</li>
<li>Worklight v5.0.6 and below - Please upgrade to v6.0 or above (preferably to v6.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM does not intend to support 64 bit for Worklight 5.0.x releases hence customers using older versions and intending to build new iOS apps to be uploaded to apple appstore need to migrate to 6.x release in order to comply with apple mandatory guidelines.</p>
