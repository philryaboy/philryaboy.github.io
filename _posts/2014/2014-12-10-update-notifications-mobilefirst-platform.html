<p>If you're currently subscribed to get Worklight notifications via IBM's "My Notifications" RSS feed or email alert system and you would like to continue getting updates for the latest releases, you will need to update your subscription to include MobileFirst Platform Foundation. Or if you've never signed up, but would like to start getting RSS feed or email notifications, you will need to add a subscription.</p>
<p>My Notifications will notify you of announcements, such as security bulletins, that may have an impact on your environment. See our Support site blog, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/aimsupport/entry/my_notifications_mobilefirst?lang=en" target="_blank">How do you get updates for IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation?</a>, for step by step details.</p>
