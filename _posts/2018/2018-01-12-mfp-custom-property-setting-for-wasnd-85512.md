### Root cause and workaround

This problem is due to a WAS ND specific feature change in the fixpacks from version 8.5.5.12 and upwards for handling SOAP connections during communications. 

The following steps fix the issue:

* Navigate to the JVM Custom properties for the WAS ND server under:
**Application servers** -> `<Server name>` -> **Process Definition** -> **Java Virtual Machine** -> **Custom properties**.

* Click on **New** and add the following property with its value set to **true**.
  ```bash
     Name:  com.ibm.ws.management.connector.soap.disableSOAPAuthCheck          
     Value: true  
   ```

In case of a WAS ND cluster, the above custom property should be set on the deployment manager and on all node agents. Restart your WAS ND servers, the error messages described above should not appear in the MobileFirst console.

>**Note:** This workaround is applicable for any version of MobileFirst foundation installed and configured with WAS ND version 8.5.5.12 and upwards.
