## Overview
{: #overview }
The MobileFirst Foundation SDK consists of a collection of pods that are available through [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org) and which you can add to your Xcode project.  
The pods correspond to core functions and other functions:

* **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation** - Implements client-to-server connectivity, handles authentication and security aspects, resource requests, and other required core functions.
* **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationJSONStore** - Contains the JSONStore framework. For more information, review the [JSONStore for iOS tutorial](../../jsonstore/ios/).
* **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationPush** - Contains the push notification framework. For more information, review the [Notifications tutorials](../../../notifications/).
* **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationWatchOS** - Contains support for Apple WatchOS.

In this tutorial you learn how to add the MobileFirst Native SDK by using CocoaPods to a new or existing iOS application. You also learn how to configure the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to recognize the application.

**Prerequisites:**

- Xcode and MobileFirst CLI installed on the developer workstation.  
- A local or remote instance of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is running.
- Read the [Setting up your MobileFirst development environment](../../../installation-configuration/development/mobilefirst) and [Setting up your iOS development environment](../../../installation-configuration/development/ios) tutorials.

> **Note:** **Keychain Sharing** capability is mandatory while running iOS apps on simulators using XCode 8.

## Adding the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Native SDK
{: #adding-the-mobilefirst-native-sdk }
Follow the instructions below to add the {{ site.data.keys.product }} Native SDK to a new or existing Xcode project, and to register the application to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.

Before you start, make sure that the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is running.  
If using a locally installed server: From a **Command-line** window, navigate to the server's folder and run the command: `./run.sh`.

### Creating an application
{: #creating-an-application }
Create an Xcode project or use an existing one (Swift or Objective-C).  

### Adding the SDK
{: #adding-the-sdk }
1. The {{ site.data.keys.product }} Native SDK is provided via CocoaPods.
    - If [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org) is already installed in your development environment, skip to step 2.
    - If CocoaPods is not installed, install it as follows:  
        - Open a **Command-line** window and navigate to the root of the Xcode project.
        - Run the command: `sudo gem install cocoapods` followed by `pod setup`. **Note:** These commands might take several minutes to complete.
2. Run the command: `pod init`. This creates a `Podfile`.
3. Using your favorite code editor, open the `Podfile`.
    - Comment out or delete the contents of the file.
    - Add the following lines and save the changes:

      ```xml
      use_frameworks!

      platform :ios, 8.0
      target "Xcode-project-target" do
          pod 'IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation'
      end
      ```
      - Replace **Xcode-project-target** with the name of your Xcode project's target.

4. Back in the command-line window, run the commands: `pod install`, followed by `pod update`. These command add the {{ site.data.keys.product }} Native SDK files, add the **mfpclient.plist** file, and generate a Pod project.  
    **Note:** The commands might take several minutes to complete.

    > <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> **Important**: From here on, use the `[ProjectName].xcworkspace` file in order to open the project in Xcode. Do **not** use the `[ProjectName].xcodeproj` file. A CocoaPods-based project is managed as a workspace containing the application (the executable) and the library (all project dependencies that are pulled by the CocoaPods manager).

### Manually adding the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Native SDK
{: #manually-adding-the-mobilefirst-native-sdk }
You can also manually add the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK:

<div class="panel-group accordion" id="adding-the-sdk-manually" role="tablist">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="ios-sdk">
            <h4 class="panel-title">
                <a class="preventScroll" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#ios-sdk" data-target="#collapse-ios-sdk" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-ios-sdk"><b>Click for instructions</b></a>
            </h4>
        </div>

        <div id="collapse-ios-sdk" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ios-sdk">
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>To manually add the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK, first download the SDK .zip file from the <b>{{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → Download Center → SDKs</b> tab.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In your Xcode project, add the {{ site.data.keys.product }} framework files to your project.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select the project root icon in the project explorer.</li>
                            <li>Select <b>File → Add Files</b> and navigate to the folder that contains the framework files previously downloaded.</li>
                            <li>Click the <b>Options</b> button.</li>
                            <li>Select <b>Copy items if needed</b> and <b>Create groups for any added folders</b>.<br/>
                            <b>Note:</b> If you do not select the <b>Copy items if needed</b> option, the framework files are not copied but are linked from their original location.</li>
                            <li>Select the main project (first option) and select the app target.</li>
                            <li>In the <b>General</b> tab, remove any frameworks that would get added automatically to <b>Linked Frameworks and Libraries</b>.</li>
                            <li>Required: In <b>Embedded Binaries</b>, add the following frameworks:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation.framework</li>
                                    <li>IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationOpenSSLUtils.framework</li>
                                    <li>IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationWatchOS.framework</li>
                                </ul>
                                Performing this step will automatically add these frameworks to <b>Linked Frameworks and Libraries</b>.
                            </li>
                            <li>In <b>Linked Frameworks and Libraries</b>, add the following frameworks:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationJSONStore.framework</li>

### Registering the application
{: #registering-the-application }
1. Open a **Command-line** window and navigate to the root of the Xcode project.  

2. Run the command:

    ```bash
    mfpdev app register
    ```
    - If a remote server is used, [use the command `mfpdev server add`](../../using-mobilefirst-cli-to-manage-mobilefirst-artifacts/#add-a-new-server-instance) to add it.

    You are asked to provide the application's BundleID. **Important**: The BundleID is **case sensitive**.  

The `mfpdev app register` CLI command first connects to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to register the application, then generates the **mfpclient.plist** file at the root of the Xcode project, and adds to it the metadata that identifies the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.  

> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> **Tip:** You can also register applications from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}:    
>
> 1. Load the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}.
> 2. Click the **New** button next to **Applications** to register a new application and follow the on-screen instructions.  
> 3. After the application is registered, navigate to the application's **Configuration Files** tab and copy or download the **mfpclient.plist** file. Follow the onscreen instructions to add the file to your project.

### Completing the setup process
{: #completing-the-setup-process }
In Xcode, right-click the project entry, click on **Add Files To [ProjectName]** and select the **mfpclient.plist** file, located at the root of the Xcode project.

### Referencing the SDK
{: #referencing-the-sdk }
Whenever you want to use the {{ site.data.keys.product }} Native SDK, make sure that you import the {{ site.data.keys.product }} framework:

Objective-C:

```objc
#import <IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation/IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation.h>
```

Swift:

```swift
import IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation
```

## Adding Support for Apple watchOS
{: #adding-support-for-apple-watchos}
If you are developing for Apple watchOS 2 and later, the Podfile must contain sections corresponding to the main app and the watchOS extension. See below example for
watchOS 2:

```xml
# Replace with the name of your watchOS application
xcodeproj 'MyWatchApp'

use_frameworks!

#use the name of the iOS target
target :MyWatchApp do
    platform :ios, 9.0
    pod 'IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation'
    end

#use the name of the watch extension target
target :MyWatchApp WatchKit Extension do
    platform :watchos, 2.0
    pod 'IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation'
end
```

Verify that the Xcode project is closed and run the `pod install` command.

## Updating the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Native SDK
{: #updating-the-mobilefirst-native-sdk }
To update the {{ site.data.keys.product }} Native SDK with the latest release, run the following command from the root folder of the Xcode project in a **Command-line** window:
