## Overview
{: #overview }
SMS notifications are a sub-set of Push Notification, as such make sure to first [go through the Push notifications in Cordova](../../) tutorials.  
SMS notifications in Cordova applications are supported for iOS and Android.

**Prerequisites:**

* Make sure you have read the following tutorials:
  * [Notifications Overview](../../)
  * [Setting up your {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} development environment](../../../installation-configuration/#installing-a-development-environment)
  * [Adding the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK to iOS applications](../../../application-development/sdk/cordova)
* {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to run locally, or a remotely running {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.
* {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }} installed on the developer workstation

* [Using an SMS subscribe servlet](#using-an-sms-subscribe-servlet)     
* [Sample Application](#sample-application)

## Notifications API
{: #notifications-api }
In SMS notifications, when registering the device, a phone number value is passed.

#### Register Device
{: #register-device }
Register the device to the push notifications service.

```javascript
MFPPush.registerNotificationsCallback(notificationReceived);

function registerDevice() {
    var phoneNumber = prompt("Enter Your 10 digit phone number");
    if(phoneNumber != null && phoneNumber!="" && /^\d+$/.test(phoneNumber)) {
        var options = {};
        options.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        MFPPush.registerDevice(options, 
        function(successResponse) {
            alert("Successfully registered");
            enableButtons();
        }, function(failureResponse) {
            alert("Failed to register");
        });
        return true;
    }

    else {
        alert("Failed to register, You have entered invalid number");
    }
}
```

> You can also register a device using the [Push Device Registration (POST) REST API](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/r_restapi_push_device_registration_post.html)

## Using an SMS subscribe servlet
{: #using-an-sms-subscribe-servlet}
REST APIs are used to send notifications to the registered devices. All forms of notifications can be sent: tag &amp; broadcast notifications, and authenticated notifications

To send a notification, a request is made using POST to the REST endpoint: `imfpush/v1/apps/<application-identifier>/messages`.  
Example URL: 

```bash
https://myserver.com:443/imfpush/v1/apps/com.sample.sms/messages
```

> To review all Push Notifications REST APIs, see the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/c_restapi_runtime.html">REST API runtime services</a> topic in the user documentation.

To send a notification, see the [sending notifications](../../sending-notifications) tutorial.
