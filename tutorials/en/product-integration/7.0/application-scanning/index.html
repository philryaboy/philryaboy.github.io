</ol>

<h2 id="scan">Scan your MobileFirst project</h2>

If you are scanning an IBM MobileFirst project that contains files that have been modified, you must rebuild the project using IBM MobileFirst before scanning.

You can launch a scan of your workspace or a selected project from the <strong>Security Analysis</strong> menu:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_scan_11.gif" class="img-responsive" />

You can also launch a project scan from its context menu:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_scan_21.gif" class="img-responsive" />

Individual applications can also be scanned:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_scan_31.gif" class="img-responsive" />

You can also scan the <strong>android</strong>, <strong>ipad</strong>, and <strong>iphone</strong> environments:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_scan_4_callout.gif" class="img-responsive" />

If you are running MobileFirst Application Scanning on OS X, you can also scan the Xcode project beneath the <strong>ipad</strong> or <strong>iphone</strong> environments.

In order to scan the <strong>ipad</strong> or <strong>iphone</strong> environments, or any Xcode project beneath one of those environments, the project for the iOS device must be built a single time in Xcode. In Xcode, open the project and choose <strong>iOS Device</strong> as the active scheme. Then invoke <strong>Product > Build For > Profiling</strong>.

You can even scan individual files:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_scan_51.gif" class="img-responsive"/>

<h2 id="open">Open the findings in MobileFirst Platform Foundation</h2>

When the scan completes, you can open the results right in MobileFirst Platform Foundation:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_findings_11.gif" class="img-responsive" />

The Security Analysis perspective in the AppScan Source for Development Eclipse plug-in offers a variety of views that allow you to explore and triage security findings.

<h2 id="explore">Explore the findings</h2>

The Findings view displays all of the security vulnerabilities that were discovered during the scan:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_findings_2.gif" class="img-responsive" />

From the Findings view, you can open the finding in the code editor, exclude findings, modify findings, view findings with different groupings, and search the findings for specific items.

Some views, such as the Vulnerability Matrix and Assessment Summary views, allow you to get an overall picture of all findings. You can also filter findings from these views:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_findings_3_4_callout.gif" class="img-responsive" />

When a finding is selected in the Findings view, the Remediation view provides context-specific intelligence for the vulnerability. The view tells you what the vulnerability is, why it is insecure, how to fix it, and how to avoid it in the future:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_findings_5.gif" class="img-responsive" />

Other views allow you to:
<ul>
  <li>Edit findings.</li>
  <li>Create, edit, and apply filters, allowing you to streamline the list of findings.</li>
  <li>Display excluded, modified, and fixed findings.</li>
  <li>Create and modify custom findings.</li>
  <li>Display search results.</li>
  <li>Organize findings according to a variety of audit reports that measure compliance with software security best practices and regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trace">Open finding details in the trace view</h2>

Notice in the Findings view that there is a Trace column. If that column contains a trace icon, you can select the finding to open it in the Trace view:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_trace_1_callout.gif" class="img-responsive" />

Double-clicking the finding opens the tainted data flow in the Trace View. Double-click any node to see the related source code.

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_trace_2_callout1.gif" class="img-responsive" />

Double-clicking the node allows you to view the source code that is causing the vulnerability â and fix it in place:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_trace_31.gif" class="img-responsive" />

Hover help in the editor reveals a cross-site scripting vulnerability in this line of code:

<img alt="missing_alt" src="application-scanning/wl_trace_41.gif" class="img-responsive" />

<h2 id="view">View the vulnerability in the source code and fix it in place</h2>

The line of code exposed by the trace is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack because unsanitized input from a third party is echoed back to the web page without first properly sanitizing the data. In this case, the data is the <code>dName</code> variable, which is completed by a third party or customer. If left unmitigated, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to run malicious JavaScript on the customerâs device.

To resolve this problem, simply use an HTML sanitization routine, such as <code>window.escape()</code>. Or, if you are using a framework like JQuery, sanitize with <code>$.text()</code>.
