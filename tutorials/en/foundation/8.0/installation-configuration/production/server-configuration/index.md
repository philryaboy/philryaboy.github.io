## Configuring {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to enable TLS V1.2
{: #configuring-mobilefirst-server-to-enable-tls-v12 }
For {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to communicate with devices that support only Transport Layer Security v1.2 (TLS) V1.2, among the SSL protocols, you must complete the following instructions.

The steps to configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) V1.2 depend on how {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} connects to devices.

* If {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is behind a reverse proxy that decrypts SSL-encoded packets from devices before it passes the packets to the application server, you must enable TLS V1.2 support on your reverse proxy. If you use IBM  HTTP Server as your reverse proxy, see [Securing IBM HTTP Server](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc6top_securing_ihs_container.html?view=kc) for instructions.
* If {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} communicates directly with devices, the steps to enable TLS V1.2 depend on whether your application serveris Apache Tomcat, WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile, or WebSphere Application Server full profile.

### Apache Tomcat
{: #apache-tomcat }
1. Confirm that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) supports TLS V1.2.
    Ensure that you have one of the following JRE versions:
    * Oracle JRE 1.7.0_75 or later
    * Oracle JRE 1.8.0_31 or later
2. Edit the **conf/server.xml** file and modify the `Connector` element that declares the HTTPS port so that the **sslEnabledProtocols** attribute has the following value: `sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1,SSLv2Hello"`.

### WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile
{: #websphere-application-server-liberty-profile }
1. Confirm that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) supports TLS V1.2.
    * If you use an IBM Java SDK, ensure that your IBM Java SDK is patched for the POODLE vulnerability. You can find the minimum IBM Java SDK versions that contain the patch for your version of WebSphere Application Server in [Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566)](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173).

        > **Note:** You can use the versions that are listed in the security bulletin or later versions.
    * If you use an Oracle Java SDK, ensure that you have one of the following versions:
        * Oracle JRE 1.7.0_75 or later
        * Oracle JRE 1.8.0_31 or later
2. If you use an IBM Java SDK, edit the **server.xml** file.
    * Add the following line: `<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="SSL_TLSv2"/>`
    * Add the `sslProtocol="SSL_TLSv2"` attribute to all existing `<ssl>` elements.

### WebSphere Application Server full profile
{: #websphere-application-server-full-profile }
1. Confirm that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) supports TLS V1.2.

    Ensure that your IBM Java SDK is patched for the POODLE vulnerability. You can find the minimum IBM Java SDK versions that contain the patch for your version of WebSphere Application Server in [Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566)](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173).
    > **Note:** You can use the versions that are listed in the security bulletin or later versions.
2. Log in to WebSphere Application Server administrative console, and click **Security → SSL certificate and key management → SSL configurations**.
3. For each SSL configuration listed, modify the configuration to enable TLS V1.2.
    * Select an SSL configuration and then, under **Additional Properties**, click **Quality of protections (QoP)** settings.
    * From the **Protocol** list, select **SSL_TLSv2**.
    * Click **Apply** and then save the changes.

## Configuring user authentication for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration
{: #configuring-user-authentication-for-mobilefirst-server-administration }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration requires user authentication. You can configure user authentication and choose an authentication method. Then, the configuration procedure depends on the web application server that you use.

> **Important:** If you use stand-alone WebSphere  Application Server full profile, use an authentication method other than the simple WebSphere authentication method (SWAM) in global security. You can use lightweight third-party authentication (LTPA). If you use SWAM, you might experience unexpected authentication failures.

You must configure authentication after the installer deploys the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration web applications in the web application server.

The {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration has the following Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) security roles defined:

* mfpadmin
* mfpdeployer
* mfpoperator
* mfpmonitor

You must map the roles to the corresponding sets of users. The **mfpmonitor** role can view data but cannot change any data. The following tables list MobileFirst roles and functions for production servers.

#### Deployment
{: #deployment }

|                        | Administrator | Deployer    | Operator    | Monitor    |

|                                     | Administrator | Deployer    | Operator    | Monitor    |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Java EE security role.              | mfpadmin      | mfpdeployer | mfpoperator | mfpmonitor |
| Upload new {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application. | Yes           | Yes         | No          | No         |
| Remove {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application.	  | Yes           | Yes         | No          | No         |
| Upload new adapter.     | Yes           | Yes         | No          | No         |
| Remove adapter.         | Yes           | Yes         | No          | No         |
| Turn on or off application authenticity testing for an application. | Yes | Yes | No | No    |
| Change properties on {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application status: Active, Active Notifying, and Disabled. | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

Basically, all roles can issue GET requests, the **mfpadmin**, **mfpdeployer**, and **mfpmonitor** roles can also issue POST and PUT requests, and the **mfpadmin** and **mfpdeployer** roles can also issue DELETE requests.

#### Requests related to push notifications
{: #requests-related-to-push-notifications }

|                        | Administrator | Deployer    | Operator    | Monitor    |

| DELETE requests {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Delete the registration of a device to push notification</li><li>Delete a subscription</li><li>Unsubscribe a device from a tag</li><li>Delete a GCM configuration</li><li>Delete an APNS configuration</li><li>Delete a tag</li></ul>{:/} | Yes           | Yes         | No          | No         |

#### Disabling
{: #disabling }

|                        | Administrator | Deployer    | Operator    | Monitor    |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Java EE security role. | mfpadmin      | mfpdeployer | mfpoperator | mfpmonitor |
| Disable the specific device, marking the state as lost or stolen so that access from any of the applications on that device is blocked.       | Yes           | Yes         | Yes          | No        |
| Disable a specific application, marking the state as disabled so that access from the specific application on that device is blocked.              | Yes           | Yes         | Yes         | No         |

If you choose to use an authentication method through a user repository such as LDAP, you can configure the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration so that you can use users and groups with the user repository to define the Access Control List (ACL) of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration. This procedure depends on the type and version of the web application server that you use.

### Configuring WebSphere Application Server full profile for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-full-profile-for-mobilefirst-server-administration }
Configure security by mapping the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration Java EE roles to a set of users for both web applications.

You define the basics of user configuration in the WebSphere  Application Server console. Access to the console is usually by this address: `https://localhost:9043/ibm/console/`

1. Select **Security → Global Security**.
2. Select **Security Configuration Wizard** to configure users.
    You can manage individual user accounts by selecting **Users and Groups → Manage Users**.
3. Map the roles **mfpadmin**, **mfpdeployer**, **mfpmonitor**, and **mfpoperator** to a set of users.
    * Select **Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers**.
    * Select the server.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, select **Applications → Enterprise applications**.
    * Select **MobileFirst_Administration_Service**.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, select **Details → Security** role to user/group mapping.
    * Perform the necessary customization.
    * Click **OK**.
    * Repeat the steps to map the roles for the console web application. This time select **MobileFirst_Administration_Console**.
    * Click **Save** to save the changes.

### Configuring WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-for-mobilefirst-server-administration }
In WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile, you configure the roles of **mfpadmin**, **mfpdeployer**, **mfpmonitor**, and **mfpoperator** in the **server.xml** configuration file of the server.

To configure the security roles, you must edit the **server.xml** file. In the `<application-bnd>` element of each `<application>` element, create `<security-role>` elements. Each `<security-role>` element is for each roles: **mfpadmin**, mfpdeployer, mfpmonitor, and mfpoperator. Map the roles to the appropriate user group name, in this example: **mfpadmingroup**, **mfpdeployergroup**, **mfpmonitorgroup**, or **mfpoperatorgroup**. These groups are defined through the `<basicRegistry>` element. You can customize this element or replace it entirely with an `<ldapRegistry>` element or a `<safRegistry>` element.

Then, to maintain good response times with a large number of installed applications, for example with 80 applications, you should configure a connection pool for the administration database.

1. Edit the **server.xml** file. For example:

   ```xml
   <security-role name="mfpadmin">
      <group name="mfpadmingroup"/>
   </security-role>
   <security-role name="mfpdeployer">
      <group name="mfpdeployergroup"/>
   </security-role>
   <security-role name="mfpmonitor">
      <group name="mfpmonitorgroup"/>
   </security-role>
   <security-role name="mfpoperator">
      <group name="mfpoperatorgroup"/>
   </security-role>

   <basicRegistry id="mfpadmin">
      <user name="admin" password="admin"/>
      <user name="guest" password="guest"/>
      <user name="demo" password="demo"/>
      <group name="mfpadmingroup">
        <member name="guest"/>
        <member name="demo"/>
      </group>
      <group name="mfpdeployergroup">
        <member name="admin" id="admin"/>
      </group>
      <group name="mfpmonitorgroup"/>
      <group name="mfpoperatorgroup"/>
   </basicRegistry>
   ```

2. Define  the **AppCenterPool** size:

   ```xml
   <connectionManager id="AppCenterPool" minPoolSize="10" maxPoolSize="40"/>
   ```

3. In the `<dataSource>` element, define a reference to the connection manager:

   ```xml
   <dataSource id="MFPADMIN" jndiName="mfpadmin/jdbc/mfpAdminDS" connectionManagerRef="AppCenterPool">
   ...
   </dataSource>
   ```

### Configuring Apache Tomcat for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration
{: #configuring-apache-tomcat-for-mobilefirst-server-administration }
You must configure the Java EE security roles for the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration on the Apache Tomcat web application server.

1. If you installed the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration manually, declare the following roles in the **conf/tomcat-users.xml** file:

   ```xml
   <role rolename="mfpadmin"/>
   <role rolename="mfpmonitor"/>
   <role rolename="mfpdeployer"/>
   <role rolename="mfpoperator"/>
   ```

2. Add roles to the selected users, for example:

   ```xml
   <user name="admin" password="admin" roles="mfpadmin"/>
   ```

3. You can define the set of users as described in the Apache Tomcat documentation, [Realm Configuration HOW-TO](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html).

## List of JNDI properties of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications
{: #list-of-jndi-properties-of-the-mobilefirst-server-web-applications }
Configure the JNDI properties for the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications that are deployed to the application server.

* [Setting up JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications](#setting-up-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-web-applications)
* [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service](#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-administration-service)
* [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} live update service](#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-live-update-service)
* [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime](#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-runtime)
* [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service](#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-push-service)

### Setting up JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications
{: #setting-up-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-web-applications }
Set up JNDI properties to configure the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications that are deployed to the application server.  
Set the JNDI environment entries in one of the following ways:

* Configure the server environment entries. The steps to configure the server environment entries depends on which application server you use:

    * **WebSphere  Application Server:**
        1. In the WebSphere Application Server administration console, go to **Applications → Application Types → WebSphere enterprise applications → application_name → Environment entries for Web modules**.
        2. In the Value fields, enter values that are appropriate to your server environment.

        ![JNDI environment entries in WebSphere](jndi_was.jpg)
    * WebSphere Application Server Liberty:

      In **liberty\_install\_dir/usr/servers/serverName**, edit the **server.xml** file, and declare the JNDI properties as follows:

      ```xml
      <application id="app_context_root" name="app_context_root" location="app_war_name.war" type="war">
            ...
      </application>
      <jndiEntry jndiName="app_context_root/JNDI_property_name" value="JNDI_property_value" />
      ```

      The context root (in the previous example: **app\_context\_root**) connects between the JNDI entry and a specific {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application. If multiple {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} applications exist on the same server, you can define specific JNDI entries for each application by using the context path prefix.

      > **Note:** Some properties are defined globally on WebSphere Application Server Liberty, without prefixing the property name by the context root. For a list of these properties, see [Global JNDI entries](../prod-env/appserver/#global-jndi-entries).

      For all other JNDI properties, the names must be prefixed with the context root of the application:

       * For the live update service, the context root must be **/[adminContextRoot]config**. For example, if the context root of the administration service is **/mfpadmin**, then the context root of the live update service must be **/mfpadminconfig**.
       * For the push service, you must define the context root as **/imfpush**. Otherwise, the client devices cannot connect to it as the context root is hardcoded in the SDK.
       * For the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration Service application, the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} and {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime, you can define the context root as you want. However, by default it is **/mfpadmin** for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration Service, **/mfpconsole** for {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, and **/mfp** for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime.

      For example:

      ```xml
      <application id="mfpadmin" name="mfpadmin" location="mfp-admin-service.war" type="war">
            ...
      </application>
      <jndiEntry jndiName="mfpadmin/mfp.admin.actions.prepareTimeout" value = "2400000" />
      ```    

    * Apache Tomcat:

      In **tomcat\_install\_dir/conf**, edit the **server.xml** file, and declare the JNDI properties as follows:

      ```xml
      <Context docBase="app_context_root" path="/app_context_root">
            <Environment name="JNDI_property_name" override="false" type="java.lang.String" value="JNDI_property_value"/>
      </Context>
      ```

        * The context path prefix is not needed because the JNDI entries are defined inside the `<Context>` element of an application.
        * `override="false"` is mandatory.
        * The `type` attribute is always `java.lang.String`, unless specified differently for the property.

      For example:

      ```xml
      <Context docBase="app_context_root" path="/app_context_root">
            <Environment name="mfp.admin.actions.prepareTimeout" override="false" type="java.lang.String" value="2400000"/>
      </Context>
      ```

* If you install with Ant tasks, you can also set the values of the JNDI properties at installation time.

  In **mfp_install_dir/MobileFirstServer/configuration-samples**, edit the configuration XML file for the Ant tasks, and declare the values for the JNDI properties by using the property element inside the following tags:

  * `<installmobilefirstadmin>`, for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration, {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, and live update services. For more information, see [Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} artifacts, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration, and live update services](../installation-reference/#ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-operations-console-mobilefirst-server-artifacts-mobilefirst-server-administration-and-live-update-services).
  * `<installmobilefirstruntime>`, for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime configuration properties. For more information, see [Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime environments](../installation-reference/#ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-runtime-environments).
  * `<installmobilefirstpush>`, for configuration of the push service. For more information, see [Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service](../installation-reference/#ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-server-push-service).

  For example:

  ```xml
  <installmobilefirstadmin ..>
        <property name = "mfp.admin.actions.prepareTimeout" value = "2400000" />
  </installmobilefirstadmin>
  ```

### List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service
{: #list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-administration-service }
When you configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service and {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} for your application server, you set optional or mandatory JNDI properties, in particular for Java Management Extensions (JMX).

The following properties can be set on the administration service web application mfp-admin-service.war.

#### JNDI properties for administration service: JMX
{: #jndi-properties-for-administration-service-jmx }

| Property                 | Optional or mandatory | Description | Restrictions |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| mfp.admin.jmx.connector  | Optional	           | The Java Management Extensions (JMX) connector type.<br/>The possible values are `SOAP` and `RMI`. The default value is SOAP. | WebSphere  Application Server only. |
| mfp.admin.jmx.host       | Optional	           | Host name for the JMX REST connection. | Liberty profile only. |

## Configuring data sources
{: #configuring-data-sources }
Find out some data source configuration details pertaining to the supported databases.

* [Managing the DB2 transaction log size](#managing-the-db2-transaction-log-size)
* [Configuring DB2 HADR seamless failover for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} and Application Center data sources](#configuring-db2-hadr-seamless-failover-for-mobilefirst-server-and-application-center-data-sources)
* [Handling stale connections](#handling-stale-connections)
* [Stale data after creating or deleting apps from {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}](#stale-data-after-creating-or-deleting-apps-from-mobilefirst-operations-console)

### Managing the DB2 transaction log size
{: #managing-the-db2-transaction-log-size }
When you deploy an application that is at least 40 MB with IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, you might receive a transaction log full error.

The following system output is an example of the transaction log full error code.

```bash
DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-964, SQLSTATE=57011
```

The content of each application is stored in the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration database.

The active log files are defined in number by the **LOGPRIMARY** and **LOGSECOND** database configuration parameters, and in size by the **LOGFILSIZ** database configuration parameter. A single transaction cannot use more log space than **LOGFILSZ** * (**LOGPRIMARY** + **LOGSECOND**) * 4096 KB.

The `DB2 GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION` command includes information about the log file size, and the number of primary and secondary log files.

Depending on the largest size of the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application that is deployed, you might need to increase the DB2  log space.

Using the `DB2 update db cfg` command, increase the **LOGSECOND** parameter. Space is not allocated when the database is activated. Instead, the space is allocated only as needed.

### Configuring DB2 HADR seamless failover for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} and Application Center data sources
{: #configuring-db2-hadr-seamless-failover-for-mobilefirst-server-and-application-center-data-sources }
You must enable the seamless failover feature with WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile and WebSphere Application Server. With this feature, you can manage an exception when a database fails over and gets rerouted by the DB2  JDBC driver.

> **Note:** DB2 HADR failover is not supported for Apache Tomcat.

By default with DB2 HADR, when the DB2 JDBC driver performs a client reroute after detecting that a database failed over during the first attempt to reuse an existing connection, the driver triggers **com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.ClientRerouteException**, with **ERRORCODE=-4498** and **SQLSTATE=08506**. WebSphere Application Server maps this exception to **com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException** before it is received by the application.

In this case, the application would have to catch the exception and execute again the transaction. The {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} and Application Center runtime environments do not manage the exception but rely on a feature that is called seamless failover. To enable this feature, you must set the **enableSeamlessFailover** JDBC property to "1".

#### WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile configuration
{: #websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-configuration }
You must edit the **server.xml** file, and add the **enableSeamlessFailover** property to the **properties.db2.jcc** element of the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} and Application Center data sources. For example:

```xml
<dataSource jndiName="jdbc/WorklightAdminDS" transactional="false">
  <jdbcDriver libraryRef="DB2Lib"/>
  <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="WLADMIN"  currentSchema="WLADMSC"
                      serverName="db2server" portNumber="50000"
                      enableSeamlessFailover= "1"
                      user="worklight" password="worklight"/>
</dataSource>
```

#### WebSphere Application Server configuration
{: #websphere-application-server-configuration }
From the WebSphere Application Server administrative console for each {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} and Application Center data source:

1. Go to **Resources → JDBC → Data sources → DataSource name**.
2. Select **New** and add the following custom property, or update the values if the properties already exist: `enableSeamlessFailover : 1`
3. Click **Apply**.
4. Save your configuration.

For more information about how to configure a connection to an HADR-enabled DB2 database, see [Setting up a connection to an HADR-enabled DB2 database](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/tdat_db2_hadr.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5%2F3-3-6-3-3-0-7-3&lang=en).

### Handling stale connections
{: #handling-stale-connections }
Configure your application server to avoid database timeout issues.

A **StaleConnectionException** is an exception that is generated by the Java application server profile database connection code when a JDBC driver returns an unrecoverable error from a connection request or operation. The **StaleConnectionException** is raised when the database vendor issues an exception to indicate that a connection currently in the connection pool is no longer valid. This exception can happen for many reasons. The most common cause of **StaleConnectionException** is due to retrieving connections from the database connection pool and finding out that the connection has timed out or dropped when it was unused for a long time.

You can configure your application server to avoid this exception.

#### Apache Tomcat configuration
{: #apache-tomcat-configuration }
**MySQL**  
The MySQL database closes its connections after a period of non-activity on a connection. This timeout is defined by the system variable called **wait_timeout**. The default is 28000 seconds (8 hours).

When an application tries to connect to the database after MySQL closes the connection, the following exception is generated:

```xml
com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLNonTransientConnectionException: No operations allowed after statement closed.
```

Edit the **server.xml** and **context.xml** files, and for every `<Resource>` element add the following properties:

* **testOnBorrow="true"**
* **validationQuery="select 1"**

For example:

```xml
<Resource name="jdbc/AppCenterDS"
  type="javax.sql.DataSource"
  driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
  ...
  testOnBorrow="true"
  validationQuery="select 1"
/>
```

#### WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile configuration
{: #websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-configuration-1 }
Edit the **server.xml** file and for every `<dataSource>` element (runtime and Application Center databases) add a `<connectionManager>` element with the agedTimeout property:

```xml
<connectionManager agedTimeout="timeout_value"/>
```

The timeout value depends mainly on the number of opened connections in parallel but also on the minimum and maximum number of the connections in the pool. Hence, you must tune the different **connectionManager** attributes to identify the most adequate values. For more information about the **connectionManager** element, see [Liberty: Configuration elements in the **server.xml** file](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/autodita/rwlp_metatype_core.html).

> **Note:** MySQL in combination with WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile or WebSphere Application Server full profile is not classified as a supported configuration. For more information, see [WebSphere Application Server Support Statement](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004311). Use IBM  DB2  or another database that is supported by WebSphere Application Server to benefit from a configuration that is fully supported by IBM Support.

### Stale data after creating or deleting apps from {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}
{: #stale-data-after-creating-or-deleting-apps-from-mobilefirst-operations-console }
On a Tomcat 8 application server, if you use a MySQL database, some calls from {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} to services return a 404 error.

On a Tomcat 8 application server, if you work with a MySQL database, when you use {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} to delete an app, or add a new one, and try to refresh the console a couple of times, you might see stale data. For example, users might see an already deleted app in the list.

To avoid this problem, change the isolation level to **READ_COMMITTED**, either in the data source, or in the database management system.

For the meaning of **READ_COMMITTED**, see the [MySQL documentation](http://www.ibm.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html?view=kc) at [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html).

* To change the isolation level to **READ_COMMITTED** in the data source, modify the **server.xml** Tomcat configuration file: In the **<Resource name="jdbc/mfpAdminDS" .../>** section, add the **defaultTransactionIsolation="READ_COMMITTED"** attribute.
* To change the isolation level to **READ_COMMITTED** globally in the database management system, refer to the [SET TRANSACTION Syntax page](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html) of the MySQL documentation at [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html).

#### WebSphere Application Server full profile configuration
{: #websphere-application-server-full-profile-configuration }
**DB2 or Oracle**  
To minimize the stale connection issues, check the connection pools configuration on each data source in WebSphere Application Server administration console.

1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server administration console.
2. Select **Resources → JDBC Providers → database_jdbc_provider → Data Sources → your_data_source → Connection pool properties**.
3. Set the **Minimum connections** value to 0.
4. Set the **Reap time** value to be lesser than the **Unused timeout** value.
5. Make sure that the **Purge policy** property is set to **EntirePool (default)**.

For more information, see [Connection pool settings](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/udat_conpoolset.html).

**MySQL**  

1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server administration console.
2. Select **Resources → JDBC → Data sources**.
3. For each MySQL data source:
    * Click the data source.
    * Select **Connection pool** properties under **Additional Properties**.
    * Modify the value of the **Aged timeout** property. The value must be lower than the MySQL **wait_timeout** system variable so that the connections are purged before MySQL closes these connections.
    * Click **OK**.

> **Note:** MySQL in combination with WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile or WebSphere Application Server full profile is not classified as a supported configuration. For more information, see [WebSphere Application Server Support Statement](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27004311). Use IBM DB2 or another database that is supported by WebSphere Application Server to benefit from a configuration that is fully supported by IBM Support.

## Configuring logging and monitoring mechanisms
{: #configuring-logging-and-monitoring-mechanisms }
{{ site.data.keys.product }} reports errors, warnings, and informational messages into a log file. The underlying logging mechanism varies by application server.

### {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}
{: #mobilefirst-server }
{{ site.data.keys.product }} ({{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} for short) uses the standard java.util.logging package. By default, all {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} logging goes to the application server log files. You can control {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} logging by using the standard tools that are available in each application server. For example, if you want to activate trace logging in WebSphere  Application Server Liberty, add a trace element to the server.xml file. To activate trace logging in WebSphere Application Server, use the logging screen in the console and enable trace for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} logs.

{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} logs all begin with **com.ibm.mfp**.  
Application Center logs begin with **com.ibm.puremeap**.

For more information about the logging models of each application server, including the location of the log files, see the documentation for the relevant application server, as shown in the following table.

| Application server | Location of documentation |
| -------------------|---------------------------|
| Apache Tomcat	     | [http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html#Using_java.util.logging_(default)](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html#Using_java.util.logging_(default)) |
| WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 full profile | 	[http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/ttrb_trcover.html](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/ttrb_trcover.html) |
| WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 Liberty profile | 	[http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_logging.html?cp=SSEQTP_8.5.5%2F1-16-0-0](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_logging.html?cp=SSEQTP_8.5.5%2F1-16-0-0) |

### Log level mappings
{: #log-level-mappings }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} uses the **java.util.logging** API. The logging levels map to the following levels:

* WL.Logger.debug: FINE
* WL.Logger.info: INFO
* WL.Logger.warn: WARNING
* WL.Logger.error: SEVERE

### Log monitoring tools
{: #log-monitoring-tools }
For Apache Tomcat, you can use [IBM  Operations Analytics - Log Analysis](http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-operations-analytics---log-analysis) or other industry standard log file monitoring tools to monitor logs and highlight errors and warnings.

For WebSphere Application Server, use the log viewing facilities that are described in IBM Knowledge Center. The URLs are listed in the table in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} section of this page.

### Back-end connectivity
{: #back-end-connectivity }
To enable trace to monitor back-end connectivity, see the documentation for your specific application server platform in the table of section {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} of this page. Use the **com.ibm.mfp.server.js.adapter** package and set the log level to **FINEST**.

### Audit log for administration operations
{: #audit-log-for-administration-operations }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} stores an audit log for login, logout, and for all administration operations, such as deploying apps or adapters or locking apps. You can disable the audit log by setting the JNDI property **mfp.admin.audit** to false on the web application of the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service (**mfp-admin-service.war**).

When the audit log is enabled, you can download it from {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} by clicking the **Audit log** link in the footer of the page.

### Login and authentication issues
{: #login-and-authentication-issues }
To diagnose login and authentication issues, enable the package **com.ibm.mfp.server.security** for trace and set the log level to **FINEST**.

## Configuring multiple runtimes
{: #configuring-multiple-runtimes }
You can configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with multiple runtimes, creating a visual differentiation between application "types" in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}.

> **Note:** multiple runtimes are not supported in a Mobile Foundation server instance created by the Mobile Foundation IBM Cloud service. In the IBM Cloud service, you must create multiple service instances instead.

#### Jump to
{: #jump-to-1 }

* [Registering applications and deploying adapters to different runtimes](#registering-applications-and-deploying-adapters-to-different-runtimes)
* [Exporting and importing runtime configurations](#exporting-and-importing-runtime-configurations)

### Configuring multiple runtimes in WebSphere Liberty profile
{: #configuring-multiple-runtimes-in-websphere-liberty-profile }

1. Open the **server.xml** file of the application server. Typically located in the  **[application-server]/usr/servers/server-name/** folder. For example, with the {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit }}, the file can be found it **[installation-folder]/mfp-server/usrs/servers/mfp/server.xml**.

2. Add a second `application` element:

   ```xml
   <application id="second-runtime" name="second-runtime" location="mfp-server.war" type="war">
        <classloader delegation="parentLast">
            </classloader>
   </application>
   ```

3. Add a second set of JNDI entries:

   ```xml
   <jndiEntry jndiName="second-runtime/mfp.analytics.url" value='"http://localhost:9080/analytics-service/rest"'/>
   <jndiEntry jndiName="second-runtime/mfp.analytics.console.url" value='"http://localhost:9080/analytics/console"'/>
   <jndiEntry jndiName="second-runtime/mfp.analytics.username" value='"admin"'/>
   <jndiEntry jndiName="second-runtime/mfp.analytics.password" value='"admin"'/>
   <jndiEntry jndiName="second-runtime/mfp.authorization.server" value='"embedded"'/>
   ```

4. Add a second `dataSource` element:

   ```xml
   <dataSource jndiName="second-runtime/jdbc/mfpDS" transactional="false">
        <jdbcDriver libraryRef="DerbyLib"/>
        <properties.derby.embedded databaseName="${wlp.install.dir}/databases/second-runtime" user='"MFPDATA"'/>
   </dataSource>
   ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > * Make sure the `dataSource` is pointing to a different database schema.
    > * Make sure you have created [another database instance](../prod-env/databases) for the new runtime.
    > * In the development environment, add `createDatabase="create"` in the `properties.derby.embedded` child-element.

5. Restart the application server.

### Registering applications and deploying adapters to different runtimes
{: #registering-applications-and-deploying-adapters-to-different-runtimes }
When a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is configured with multiple runtimes, the registration of applications and deployment of adapters is slightly different.

* [Registering and deploying from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}](#registering-and-deploying-from-the-mobilefirst-operations-console)
* [Registering and deploying from the Command-line](#registering-and-deploying-from-the-command-line)

#### Registering and deploying from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}
{: #registering-and-deploying-from-the-mobilefirst-operations-console }
When performing these actions in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, you now need to select the runtime to register or deploy to.

<img class="gifplayer" alt="Multiple runtimes in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}" src="register-and-deploy-to-multiple-runtimes.png"/>

#### Registering and deploying from the Command-line
{: #registering-and-deploying-from-the-command-line }
When performing these actions using the **mfpdev** command-line tool, you now need to add the runtime name to register or deploy to.

To register an application: `mfpdev app register <server-name> <runtime-name>`.  

```bash
mfpdev app register local second-runtime
```

To deploy an adapter: `mfpdev adapter deploy <server-name> <runtime-name>`.  

```bash
mfpdev adapter deploy local second-runtime
```

* **local** is the name of the default server definition in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }}. Replace *local* with a the server definition name you need to register or deploy to.
* **runtime-name** is the name of the runtime to register or deploy to.

> Learn more with the following CLI help commands:
>
> * `mfpdev help server add`
> * `mfpdev help app register`
> * `mfpdev help adapter deploy`

## Exporting and importing runtime configurations
{: #exporting-and-importing-runtime-configurations }
You can export a runtime configuration and import it to another {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} using the REST APIs of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} **administration service**.

For example, you can setup a runtime configuration in a development environment, export its configuration and then import it to a testing environment for a quick set-up, and then further configure it for the specific needs of the testing environment.

> Find out all available REST APIs [in the API Reference](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/apiref/c_restapi_oview.html).

## Configuring license tracking
{: #configuring-license-tracking }
License tracking is enabled by default. Read the following topics to learn how you can configure license tracking. For more information about license tracking, see [License tracking](../../../administering-apps/license-tracking).

* [Configuring license tracking for client device and addressable device](#configuring-license-tracking-for-client-device-and-addressable-device)
* [Configuring IBM License Metric Tool log files](#configuring-ibm-license-metric-tool-log-files)

### Configuring license tracking for client device and addressable device
{: #configuring-license-tracking-for-client-device-and-addressable-device }
License tracking for client devices and addressable device is enabled by default. License reports are available in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}. You can specify the following JNDI properties to change the default settings for license tracking.

> **Note:** If you have a contract that defines the use of token licensing, see also [Installing and configuring for token licensing](../token-licensing).

You can specify the following JNDI properties to change the default settings for license tracking.

**mfp.device.decommission.when**  
The number of days of inactivity after which a device is decommissioned by the device decommissioning task. License reports do not count decommissioned devices as active devices. The default value for the property is 90 days. Do not set a value lower than 30 days if your software is licensed by Client Device or by Addressable Device, or license reports might not be sufficient to prove compliance.

**mfp.device.archiveDecommissioned.when**  
A value, in days, that defines when decommissioned devices are placed in an archive file when the decommissioning task is run. The archived devices are written to a file in the IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} **home\devices_archive** directory. The name of the file contains the time stamp when the archive file is created. The default value is 90 days.

**mfp.device.decommissionProcessingInterval**  
Defines how often (in seconds) the decommissioning task is run. Default: 86400, which is one day. The decommissioning task performs the following actions:

* Decommissions inactive devices, based on the **mfp.device.decommission.when** setting.
* Optionally, archives older decommissioned devices, based on the **mfp.device.archiveDecommissioned.when** setting.
* Generates the license tracking report.

**mfp.licenseTracking.enabled**  
A value that is used to enable or disable license tracking in {{ site.data.keys.product }}. By default, license tracking is enabled. For performance reasons, you can disable this flag when {{ site.data.keys.product }} is not licensed by Client Device or by Addressable Device. When device tracking is disabled, the license reports are also disabled and no license metrics are generated. In that case, only IBM  License Metric Tool records for Application count are generated.

For more information about specifying JNDI properties, see [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime](#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-runtime).

### Configuring IBM License Metric Tool log files
{: #configuring-ibm-license-metric-tool-log-files }
{{ site.data.keys.product }} generates IBM  Software License Metric Tag (SLMT) files. Versions of IBM License Metric Tool that support IBM Software License Metric Tag can generate License Consumption Reports. Read this to understand how to configure the location and the maximum size of the generated files.

By default, the IBM Software License Metric Tag files are in the following directories:

* On Windows: **%ProgramFiles%\ibm\common\slm**
* On UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems: **/var/ibm/common/slm**

If the directories are not writable, the files are created in the log directory of the application server that runs the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime environment.

You can configure the location and management of those files with the following properties:

* **license.metric.logger.output.dir**: Location of the IBM Software License Metric Tag files
* **license.metric.logger.file.size**: Maximum size of an SLMT file before a rotation is performed. The default size is 1 MB.
* **license.metric.logger.file.number**: Maximum number of SLMT archive files to keep in rotations. The default number is 10.

To change the default values, you must create a Java property file, with the format **key=value**, and provide the path to the properties file through the **license_metric_logger_configuration** JVM property.

## WebSphere Application Server SSL configuration and HTTP adapters
{: #websphere-application-server-ssl-configuration-and-http-adapters }
By setting a property, you can let HTTP adapters benefit from WebSphere  SSL configuration.

By default, HTTP adapters do not use WebSphere SSL by concatenating the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) truststore with the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} keystore, which is described in [Configuring the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} keystore](../../../authentication-and-security/configuring-the-mobilefirst-server-keystore). Also see [Configuring SSL between adapters and back-end servers by using self-signed certificates](../../../administering-apps/deployment/#configuring-ssl-between-adapters-and-back-end-servers-by-using-self-signed-certificates).

To have HTTP adapters use the WebSphere SSL configuration, set the **ssl.websphere.config** JNDI property to true. The setting has the following effects in order of precedence:

1. Adapters running on WebSphere use the WebSphere keystore and not the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} keystore.
2. If the **ssl.websphere.alias** property is set, the adapter uses the SSL configuration that is associated with the alias as set in this property.
