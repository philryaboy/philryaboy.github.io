## Ant configuredatabase task reference
{: #ant-configuredatabase-task-reference }
Reference information for the configuredatabase Ant task. This reference information is for relational databases only. It does not apply to Cloudant .

The **configuredatabase** Ant task creates the relational databases that are used by {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} live update service, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service, {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime, and the Application Center services. This Ant task configures a relational database through the following actions:

* Checks whether the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} tables exist and creates them if necessary.
* If the tables exist for an older version of {{ site.data.keys.product }}, migrates them to the current version.
* If the tables exist for the current version of {{ site.data.keys.product }}, does nothing.

In addition, if one of the following conditions is met:

* The DBMS type is Derby.
* An inner element `<dba>` is present.
* The DBMS type is DB2 , and the specified user has the permissions to create databases.

Then, the task can have the following effects:

* Create the database if necessary (except for Oracle 12c, and Cloudant).
* Create a user, if necessary, and grants that user access rights to the database.

> **Note:** The configuredatabase Ant task has not effect if you use it with Cloudant.

### Attributes and elements for configuredatabase task
{: #attributes-and-elements-for-configuredatabase-task }

The **configuredatabase** task has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Required | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| kind      | The type of database: In {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}: MobileFirstRuntime, MobileFirstConfig, MobileFirstAdmin, or push. In Application Center: ApplicationCenter. | Yes | None |
| includeConfigurationTables | To specify whether to perform database operations on both the live update service and the administration service or on the administration service only. The value is either true or false. |  No | true |
| execute | To specify whether to execute the configuredatabase Ant task. The value is either true or false. | No | true |

#### kind
{: #kind }
{{ site.data.keys.product }} supports four kinds of database: {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime uses **MobileFirstRuntime** database. {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service uses the **MobileFirstAdmin** database. {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} Live Update service uses the **MobileFirstConfig** database. By default, it is created with **MobileFirstAdmin** kind. {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service uses the **push** database. Application Center uses the **ApplicationCenter** database.

#### includeConfigurationTables
{: #includeconfigurationtables }
The **includeConfigurationTables** attribute can be used only when the **kind** attribute is **MobileFirstAdmin**. The valid value can be true or false. When this attribute is set to true, the **configuredatabase** task performs database operations on both the administration service database and the Live Update service database in a single run. When this attribute is set to false, the **configuredatabase** task performs database operations only on the administration service database.

#### execute
{: #execute }
The **execute** attribute enables or disables the execution of the **configuredatabase** Ant task. The valid value can be true or false. When this attribute is set to false, the **configuredatabase** task performs no configuration or database operations.

The **configuredatabase** task supports the following elements:

> `Note:` If you specify the database with the alternative attributes, this database must exist, the user account must exist, and the database must already be accessible to the user. In this case, the **configuredatabase** task does not attempt to create the database or the user, nor does it attempt to grant access to the user. The **configuredatabase** task ensures only that the database has the required tables for the current {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} version. You do not have to specify the inner elements `<dba>` or `<client>`.

#### Oracle
{: #oracle }
The element `<oracle>` has the following attributes:

| Attribute      | Description                                                              | Required | Default |

| systemPassword | The password for the user SYSTEM.                                        | No       | Queried interactively if the database or the user does not exist yet |

> `Note:` For the user attribute, use preferably a user name in uppercase letters. Oracle user names are generally in uppercase letters. Unlike other database tools, the **configuredatabase** Ant task does not convert lowercase letters to uppercase letters in the user name. If the **configuredatabase** Ant task fails to connect to your database, try to enter the value for the **user** attribute in uppercase letters.

For more information about Oracle user accounts, see [Overview of Authentication Methods](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/security.htm#i12374).  
The `<oracle>` element supports the following elements:

| Element      | Description                                      | Count |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `<property>` | The JDBC connection property.                    | 0..∞  |
| `<dba>`      | The database administrator credentials.          | 0..1  |

For information about the available connection properties, see [Class OracleDriver](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e13995/oracle/jdbc/OracleDriver.html).  
The inner element `<dba>` specifies the database administrator credentials. This element has the following attributes:

| Attribute      | Description                                                              | Required | Default |

The `<driverclasspath>` element must contain an Oracle JDBC driver JAR file. You can download Oracle JDBC drivers from [JDBC, SQLJ, Oracle JPublisher and Universal Connection Pool (UCP)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html).

You cannot specify details of table allocation, such as the table space, by using the Ant task. To control the table space, you can create the user account manually and assign it a default table space before you run the Ant task. To control other details, you must use the manual instructions in section [Oracle database and user requirements](../prod-env/databases/#oracle-database-and-user-requirements).

| Attribute | Description                            | Required | Default               |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| url       | The database connection URL.	         | Yes      | None                  |
| user	    | The user name for accessing databases. | Yes      | None                  |
| password	| The password for accessing databases.	 | No       | Queried interactively |

> **Note:** If you specify the database with the alternative attributes, this database must exist, the user account must exist, and the database must already be accessible to the user. In this case, the task does not attempt to create the database or the user, nor does it attempt to grant access to the user. The **configuredatabase** task ensures only that the database has the required tables for the current {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} version. You do not have to specify the inner element `<dba>`.

## Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} artifacts, {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration, and live update services
{: #ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-operations-console-mobilefirst-server-artifacts-mobilefirst-server-administration-and-live-update-services }
The **installmobilefirstadmin**, **updatemobilefirstadmin**, and **uninstallmobilefirstadmin** Ant tasks are provided for the installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, the artifacts component, the administration service, and the live update service.

### Task effects
{: #task-effects }

#### installmobilefirstadmin
{: #installmobilefirstadmin }
The **installmobilefirstadmin** Ant task configures an application server to run the WAR files of the administration and live update services as web applications, and optionally, to install the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}. This task has the following effects:

* It declares the administration service web application in the specified context root, by default /mfpadmin.
* It declares the live update service web application in a context root derived from the specified context root of the administration service. By default, /mfpadminconfig.
* For the relational databases, it declares data sources and on WebSphere  Application Server full profile, JDBC providers for the administration services.
* It deploys the administration service and the live update service on the application server.
* Optionally, it declares{{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} as a web application in the specified context root, by default /mfpconsole. If the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} instance is specified, the Ant task declares the appropriate JNDI environment entry to communicate with the corresponding management service. For example,

```xml
<target name="adminstall">
  <installmobilefirstadmin servicewar="${mfp.service.war.file}">
    <console install="${mfp.admin.console.install}" warFile="${mfp.console.war.file}"/>
```

* Optionally, it declares the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} artifacts web application in the specified context root /mfp-dev-artifacts when {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} is installed.
* It configures the configuration properties for the administration service by using JNDI environment entries. These JNDI environment entries also give some additional information about the application server topology, for example whether the topology is a stand-alone configuration, a cluster, or a server farm.
* Optionally, it configures users that it maps to roles used by {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, and the administration and live update services web applications.
* It configures the application server for use of JMX.
* Optionally, it configures the communication with the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service.
* Optionally, it sets the MobileFirst JNDI environment entries to configure the application server as a server farm member for the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration part.

#### updatemobilefirstadmin
{: #updatemobilefirstadmin }
The **updatemobilefirstadmin** Ant task updates an already-configured {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web application on an application server. This task has the following effects:

* It updates the administration service WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.
* It updates the live update service WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.
* It updates the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.
The task does not change the application server configuration, that is, the web application configuration, data sources, JNDI environment entries, user-to-role mappings, and JMX configuration.

#### uninstallmobilefirstadmin
{: #uninstallmobilefirstadmin }
The **uninstallmobilefirstadmin** Ant task undoes the effects of an earlier run of installmobilefirstadmin. This task has the following effects:

* It removes the configuration of the administration service web application with the specified context root. As a consequence, the task also removes the settings that were added manually to that application.
* It removes the WAR files of the administration and live update services, and {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} from the application server as an option.
* For the relational DBMS, it removes the data sources and on WebSphere Application Server Full Profile the JDBC providers for the administration and live update services.
* For the relational DBMS, it removes the database drivers that were used by the administration and live update services from the application server.
* It removes the associated JNDI environment entries.
* On WebSphere Application Server Liberty and Apache Tomcat, it removes the users configured by the installmobilefirstadmin invocation.
* It removes the JMX configuration.

### Attributes and elements
{: #attributes-and-elements }
The **installmobilefirstadmin**, **updatemobilefirstadmin**, and **uninstallmobilefirstadmin** Ant tasks have the following attributes:

| Attribute         | Description                                                              | Required | Default |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| contextroot       | The common prefix for URLs to the administration service to get information about {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime environments, applications, and adapters. | No | /mfpadmin |
| id                | To distinguish different deployments.              | No | Empty |
| environmentId     | To distinguish different {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} environments. | No | Empty |
| servicewar        | The WAR file for the administration service.       | No | The mfp-admin-service.war file is in the same directory as the mfp-ant-deployer.jar file. |
| shortcutsDir      | The directory where to place shortcuts.            | No | None |
| wasStartingWeight | The start order for WebSphere Application Server. Lower values start first. | No | 1 |

#### contextroot and id
{: #contextroot-and-id }
The **contextroot** and **id** attributes distinguish different deployments of {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} and the administration service.

In WebSphere Application Server Liberty profiles and in Tomcat environments, the contextroot parameter is sufficient for this purpose. In WebSphere Application Server Full profile environments, the id attribute is used instead. Without this id attribute, two WAR files with the same context roots might conflict and these files would not be deployed.

#### environmentId
{: #environmentid }
Use the **environmentId** attribute to distinguish several environments, consisting each of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service and {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime web applications, that must operate independently. For example, with this option you can host a test environment, a pre-production environment, and a production environment on the same server or in the same WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cell. This environmentId attribute creates a suffix that is added to MBean names that the administration service and the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime projects use when they communicate through Java Management Extensions (JMX).

#### servicewar
{: #servicewar }
Use the **servicewar** attribute to specify a different directory for the administration service WAR file. You can specify the name of this WAR file with an absolute path or a relative path.

#### shortcutsDir
{: #shortcutsdir }
The **shortcutsDir** attribute specifies where to place shortcuts to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}. If you set this attribute, you can add the following files to that directory:

* **mobilefirst-console.url** - this file is a Windows shortcut. It opens the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} in a browser.
* **mobilefirst-console.sh**- this file is a UNIX shell script and opens the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} in a browser.
* **mobilefirst-admin-service.url** - this file is a Windows shortcut. It opens in a browser and calls a REST service that returns a list of the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} projects that can be managed in JSON format. For each listed {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} project, some details are also available about their artifacts, such as the number of applications, the number of adapters, the number of active devices, the number of decommissioned devices. The list also indicates whether the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} project runtime is running or idle.
* **mobilefirst-admin-service.sh** - this file is a UNIX shell script that provides the same output as the **mobilefirst-admin-service.url** file.

#### wasStartingWeight
{: #wasstartingweight }
Use the **wasStartingWeight** attribute to specify a value that is used in WebSphere Application Server as a weight to ensure that a start order is respected. As a result of the start order value, the administration service web application is deployed and started before any other {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime projects. If {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} projects are deployed or started before the web application, the JMX communication is not established and the runtime cannot synchronize with the administration service database and cannot handle server requests.

## Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service
{: #ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-server-push-service }
The **installmobilefirstpush**, **updatemobilefirstpush**, and **uninstallmobilefirstpush** Ant tasks are provided for the installation of the push service.

### Task effects
{: #task-effects-1 }
#### installmobilefirstpush
{: #installmobilefirstpush }
The **installmobilefirstpush** Ant task configures an application server to run the push service WAR file as web application. This task has the following effects:
It declares the push service web application in the **/imfpush** context root. The context root cannot be changed.
For the relational databases, it declares data sources and, on WebSphere  Application Server Full Profile, JDBC providers for push service.
It configures the configuration properties for the push service by using JNDI environment entries. These JNDI environment entries configure the OAuth communication with the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} authorization server, {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }}, and with Cloudant  in case Cloudant is used.

#### updatemobilefirstpush
{: #updatemobilefirstpush }
The **updatemobilefirstpush** Ant task updates an already-configured {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web application on an application server. This task updates the push service WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.

#### uninstallmobilefirstpush
{: #uninstallmobilefirstpush }
The **uninstallmobilefirstpush** Ant task undoes the effects of an earlier run of **installmobilefirstpush**. This task has the following effects:
It removes the configuration of the push service web application with the specified context root. As a consequence, the task also removes the settings that were added manually to that application.
It removes the push service WAR file from the application server as an option.
For the relational DBMS, it removes the data sources and on WebSphere Application Server Full Profile – the JDBC providers for the push service.
It removes the associated JNDI environment entries.

### Attributes and elements
{: #attributes-and-elements-1 }
The **installmobilefirstpush**, **updatemobilefirstpush**, and **uninstallmobilefirstpush** Ant tasks have the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description                           | Required | Default     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|----------|-------------|

| warFile	| The WAR file for the push service.	| No	   | The ../PushService/mfp-push-service.war file is relative to the MobileFirstServer directory that contains the  mfp-ant-deployer.jar file. |

### Id
{: #id }
The **id** attribute distinguishes different deployments of the push service in the same WebSphere Application Server cell. Without this id attribute, two WAR files with the same context roots might conflict and these files would not be deployed.

### warFile
{: #warfile }
Use the **warFile** attribute to specify a different directory for the push service WAR file. You can specify the name of this WAR file with an absolute path or a relative path.

The **installmobilefirstpush**, **updatemobilefirstpush**, and **uninstallmobilefirstpush** Ant tasks support the following elements:

| Element               | Description             | Count |

### To specify a connection to the push service database
{: #to-specify-a-connection-to-the-push-service-database-1 }
The `<database>` element collects the parameters that specify a data source declaration in an application server to access the push service database.

You must declare a single database: `<database kind="Push">`. You specify the `<database>` element similarly to the configuredatabase Ant task, except that the `<database>` element does not have the `<dba>` and `<client>` elements. It might have `<property>` elements.

The `<database>` element has the following attributes:

## Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime environments
{: #ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-runtime-environments }
Reference information for the **installmobilefirstruntime**, **updatemobilefirstruntime**, and **uninstallmobilefirstruntime** Ant tasks.

### Task effects
{: #task-effects-2 }

#### installmobilefirstruntime
{: #installmobilefirstruntime }
The **installmobilefirstruntime** Ant task configures an application server to run a {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime WAR file as a web application. This task has the following effects.

* It declares the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} web application in the specified context root, by default /mfp.
* It deploys the runtime WAR file on the application server.
* It declares data sources and on WebSphere  Application Server full profile JDBC providers for the runtime.
* It deploys the database drivers in the application server.
* It sets {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} configuration properties through JNDI environment entries.
* Optionally, it sets the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} JNDI environment entries to configure the application server as a server farm member for the runtime.

#### updatemobilefirstruntime
{: #updatemobilefirstruntime }
The **updatemobilefirstruntime** Ant task updates a {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime that is already configured on an application server. This task updates the runtime WAR file. The file must have the same base name as the runtime WAR file that was previously deployed. Other than that, the task does not change the application server configuration, that is, the web application configuration, data sources, and JNDI environment entries.

#### uninstallmobilefirstruntime
{: #uninstallmobilefirstruntime }
The **uninstallmobilefirstruntime** Ant task undoes the effects of an earlier **installmobilefirstruntime** run. This task has the following effects.

* It removes the configuration of the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} web application with the specified context root. The task also removes the settings that are added manually to that application.
* It removes the runtime WAR file from the application server.
* It removes the data sources and on WebSphere Application Server full profile the JDBC providers for the runtime.
* It removes the associated JNDI environment entries.

### Attributes and elements
{: #attributes-and-elements-2 }
The **installmobilefirstruntime**, **updatemobilefirstruntime**, and **uninstallmobilefirstruntime** Ant tasks have the following attributes:

| Attribute         | Description                                                                 | Required   | Default                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| contextroot       | The common prefix in URLs to the application (context root).                | No | /mfp  |
| id	            | To distinguish different deployments.                                       | No | Empty |
| environmentId	    | To distinguish different {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} environments.                          | No | Empty |
| warFile	        | The WAR file for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime.                                       | No | The mfp-server.war file is in the same directory as the mfp-ant-deployer.jar file. |
| wasStartingWeight | The start order for WebSphere Application Server. Lower values start first. | No | 2     |                           |

#### contextroot and id
{: #contextroot-and-id-1 }
The **contextroot** and **id** attributes distinguish different {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} projects.

In WebSphere Application Server Liberty profiles and in Tomcat environments, the contextroot parameter is sufficient for this purpose. In WebSphere Application Server full profile environments, the id attribute is used instead.

#### environmentId
{: #environmentid-1 }
Use the **environmentId** attribute to distinguish several environments, consisting each of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service and {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime web applications, that must operate independently. You must set this attribute to the same value for the runtime application as the one that was set in the <installmobilefirstadmin> invocation, for the administration service application.

#### warFile
{: #warfile-1 }
Use the **warFile** attribute to specify a different directory for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime WAR file. You can specify the name of this WAR file with an absolute path or a relative path.

#### wasStartingWeight
{: #wasstartingweight-1 }
Use the **wasStartingWeight** attribute to specify a value that is used in WebSphere Application Server as a weight to ensure that a start order is respected. As a result of the start order value, the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration service web application is deployed and started before any other {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime projects. If {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} projects are deployed or started before the web application, the JMX communication is not established and you cannot manage your {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} projects.

## Ant tasks for installation of Application Center
{: #ant-tasks-for-installation-of-application-center }
The `<installApplicationCenter>`, `<updateApplicationCenter>`, and `<uninstallApplicationCenter>` Ant tasks are provided for the installation of the Application Center Console and Services.

### Task effects
{: #task-effects-3 }
### installApplicationCenter
{: #installapplicationcenter }
The `<installApplicationCenter>` task configures an application server to run the Application Center Services WAR file as a web application, and to install the Application Center Console. This task has the following effects:

* It declares the Application Center Services web application in the /applicationcenter context root.
* It declares data sources, and on WebSphere  Application Server full profile, it declares also JDBC providers for Application Center Services.
* It deploys the Application Center Services web application on the application server.
* It declares the Application Center Console as a web application in the /appcenterconsole context root.
* It deploys the Application Center Console WAR file on the application server.
* It configures configuration properties for Application Center Services by using JNDI environment entries. The JNDI environment entries that are related to the endpoint and proxies are commented. You must uncomment them in some cases.
* It configures users that it maps to roles used by the Application Center Console and Services web applications.
* On WebSphere Application Server, it configures the necessary custom property for the web container.

#### updateApplicationCenter
{: #updateApplicationCenter }
The `<updateApplicationCenter>` task updates an already configured Application Center application on an application server. This task has the following effects:

* It updates the Application Center Services WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.
* It updates the Application Center Console WAR file. This file must have the same base name as the corresponding WAR file that was previously deployed.

The task does not change the application server configuration, that is, the web application configuration, data sources, JNDI environment entries, and user-to-role mappings. This task applies only to an installation that is performed by using the <installApplicationCenter> task that is described in this topic.

> **Note:** On WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, the task does not change the features, which leaves a potential non-minimal list of features in the server.xml file for the installed application.

#### uninstallApplicationCenter
{: #uninstallApplicationCenter }
The `<uninstallApplicationCenter>` Ant task undoes the effects of an earlier run of `<installApplicationCenter>`. This task has the following effects:

* It removes the configuration of the Application Center Services web application with the **/applicationcenter** context root. As a consequence, the task also removes the settings that were added manually to that application.
* It removes both the Application Center Services and Console WAR files from the application server.
* It removes the data sources and, on WebSphere Application Server full profile, it also removes the JDBC providers for the Application Center Services.
* It removes the database drivers that were used by Application Center Services from the application server.
* It removes the associated JNDI environment entries.
* It removes the users who are configured by the `<installApplicationCenter>` invocation.

### Attributes and elements
{: #attributes-and-elements-3 }
The `<installApplicationCenter>`, `<updateApplicationCenter>`, and `<uninstallApplicationCenter>` tasks have the following attributes:

| Attribute    | Description                                | Required | Default |

| shortcutsDir | The directory where you place the shortcuts. | No | None |
| aaptDir | The directory that contains the aapt program, from the Android SDK platform-tools package. | No | None |

#### id
{: #id-1 }
In WebSphere Application Server full profile environments, the **id** attribute is used to distinguish different deployments of Application Center Console and Services. Without this **id** attribute, two WAR files with the same context roots might conflict and these files would not be deployed.

#### servicewar
{: #servicewar-1 }
Use the **servicewar** attribute to specify a different directory for the Application Center Services WAR file. You can specify the name of this WAR file with an absolute path or a relative path.

#### shortcutsDir
{: #shortcutsdir-1 }
The **shortcutsDir** attribute specifies where to place shortcuts to the Application Center Console. If you set this attribute, the following files are added to this directory:

* **appcenter-console.url**: This file is a Windows shortcut. It opens the Application Center Console in a browser.
* **appcenter-console.sh**: This file is a UNIX shell script. It opens the Application Center Console in a browser.

#### aaptDir
{: #aaptdir }
The **aapt** program is part of the {{ site.data.keys.product }} distribution: **product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk**.  
If this attribute is not set, during the upload of an apk application, Application Center parses it by using its own code, which might have limitations.

The `<installApplicationCenter>`, `<updateApplicationCenter>`, and `<uninstallApplicationCenter>` tasks support the following elements:

It supports the following element:

| Element       | Description	| Count   |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| elasticsearch	| ElasticSearch | cluster |

The `<elasticsearch>` element collects the parameters about an ElasticSearch cluster.

| Attribute        | Description                                   | Required | Default   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| clusterName	   | The ElasticSearch cluster name.	           | No       | worklight |
| nodeName	       | The ElasticSearch node name. This name must be unique in an ElasticSearch cluster.	| No | `worklightNode_<random number>` |
| mastersList	   | A comma-delimited string that contains the host name and ports of the ElasticSearch master nodes in the ElasticSearch cluster (For example: hostname1:transport-port1,hostname2:transport-port2)	           | No       |	Depends on the topology |
| dataPath	       | The ElasticSearch cluster location.	       | No	      | Depends on the application server |
| shards	       | The number of shards that the ElasticSearch cluster creates. This value can be set only by the master nodes that are created in the ElasticSearch cluster.	| No | 5 |
| replicasPerShard | The number of replicas for each shard in the ElasticSearch cluster. This value can be set only by the master nodes that are created in the ElasticSearch cluster. | No | 1 |
| transportPort	   | The port used for node-to-node communication in the ElasticSearch cluster.	| No | 9600 |

#### clusterName
{: #clustername }
Use the **clusterName** attribute to specify a name of your choice for the ElasticSearch cluster.

An ElasticSearch cluster consists of one or more nodes that share the same cluster name so you might specify the same value for the **clusterName** attribute if you configure several nodes.

#### nodeName
{: #nodename }
Use the **nodeName** attribute to specify a name of your choice for the node to configure in the ElasticSearch cluster. Each node name must be unique in the ElasticSearch cluster even if nodes span on several machines.

#### mastersList
{: #masterslist }
Use the **mastersList** attribute to provide a comma-separated list of the master nodes in your ElasticSearch cluster. Each master node in this list must be identified by its host name, and the ElasticSearch node-to-node communication port. This port is 9600 by default, or it is the port number that you specified with the attribute **transportPort** when you configured that master node.

For example: `hostname1:transport-port1, hostname2:transport-port2`.

**Note:**

* If you specify a **transportPort** that is different than the default value 9600, you must also set this value with the attribute **transportPort**. By default, when the attribute **mastersList** is omitted, an attempt is made to detect the host name and the ElasticSearch transport port on all supported application servers.
* If the target application server is WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cluster, and if you add or remove a server from this cluster at a later point in time, you must edit this list manually to keep in sync with the ElasticSearch cluster.

#### dataPath
{: #datapath }
Use the **dataPath** attribute to specify a different directory to store ElasticsSearch data. You can specify an absolute path or a relative path.

If the attribute **dataPath** is not specified, then ElasticSearch cluster data is stored in a default directory that is called **analyticsData**, whose location depends on the application server:

* For WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, the location is `${wlp.user.dir}/servers/serverName/analyticsData`.
* For Apache Tomcat, the location is `${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/analyticsData`.
* For WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, the location is `${was.install.root}/profiles/<profileName>/analyticsData`.

The directory **analyticsData** and the hierarchy of sub-directories and files that it contains are automatically created at run time, if they do not already exist when the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Service component receives events.

#### shards
{: #shards }
Use the **shards** attribute to specify the number of shards to create in the ElasticSearch cluster.

#### replicasPerShard
{: #replicaspershard }
Use the **replicasPerShard** attribute to specify the number of replicas to create for each shard in the ElasticSearch cluster.

Each shard can have zero or more replicas. By default, each shard has one replica, but the number of replicas can be changed dynamically on an existing index in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }}. A replica shard can never be started on the same node as its shard.

#### transportPort
{: #transportport }
Use the **transportPort** attribute to specify a port that other nodes in the ElasticSearch cluster must use when communicating with this node. You must ensure that this port is available and accessible if this node is behind a proxy or firewall.

### To specify an application server
{: #to-specify-an-application-server-4 }
Use the `<applicationserver>` element to define the parameters that depend on the underlying application server. The `<applicationserver>` element supports the following elements.

**Note:** The attributes and inner elements of this element are described in the tables of [Ant tasks for installation of {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime environments](#ant-tasks-for-installation-of-mobilefirst-runtime-environments).

| Element                                   | Description	| Count   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|
| **websphereapplicationserver** or **was** | The parameters for WebSphere Application Server.	| 0..1 |
| tomcat	                                | The parameters for Apache Tomcat.	| 0..1 |

**Note on MySQL:** MySQL in combination with WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile or WebSphere Application Server full profile is not classified as a supported configuration. For more information, see WebSphere Application Server Support Statement. Consider using IBM  DB2 or another database that is supported by WebSphere Application Server to benefit from a configuration that is fully supported by IBM Support.

**Note on configuration files for WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment:** The configuration files for **wasnd** contain a scope that can be set to **cluster**, **node**, **server**, or **cell**. For example, for **configure-wasnd-cluster-derby.xml**, the scope is **cluster**. These scope types define the deployment target as follows:

* **cluster**: To deploy to a cluster.
* **server**: To deploy to a single server that is managed by the deployment manager.
* **node**: To deploy to all the servers that are running on a node, but that do not belong to a cluster.
* **cell**: To deploy to all the servers on a cell.

## Sample configuration files for {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }}
{: #sample-configuration-files-for-mobilefirst-analytics }
{{ site.data.keys.product }} includes a number of sample configuration files to help you get started with the Ant tasks to install the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services, and the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }}.

The easiest way to get started with the `<installanalytics>`, `<updateanalytics>`, and `<uninstallanalytics>` Ant tasks is by working with the sample configuration files provided in the **Analytics/configuration-samples/** directory of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} distribution.

### Step 1
{: #step-1 }
Pick the appropriate sample configuration file. The following XML files are provided. They are referred to as **configure-file.xml** in the next steps.

| Task | Application server |
|------|--------------------|
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile | configure-liberty-analytics.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on Apache Tomcat | configure-tomcat-analytics.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere Application Server full profile | configure-was-analytics.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, single server | configure-wasnd-server-analytics.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, cell | configure-wasnd-cell-analytics.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, node | configure-wasnd-node.xml |
| Install {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and Console on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, cluster | configure-wasnd-cluster-analytics.xml |

**Note on configuration files for WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment:**  
The configuration files for wasnd contain a scope that can be set to **cluster**, **node**, **server**, or **cell**. For example, for **configure-wasnd-cluster-analytics.xml**, the scope is **cluster**. These scope types define the deployment target as follows:

* **cluster**: To deploy to a cluster.
* **server**: To deploy to a single server that is managed by the deployment manager.
* **node**: To deploy to all the servers that are running on a node, but that do not belong to a cluster.
* **cell**: To deploy to all the servers on a cell.

### Step 2
{: #step-2 }
Change the file access rights of the sample file to be as restrictive as possible. Step 3 requires that you supply some passwords. If you must prevent other users on the same computer from learning these passwords, you must remove the read permissions of the file for users other than yourself. You can use a command, such as the following examples:

On UNIX: `chmod 600 configure-file.xml`
On Windows: `cacls configure-file.xml /P Administrators:F %USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME%:F`

### Step 3
{: #step-3 }
Similarly, if your application server is WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, or Apache Tomcat, and the server is meant to be started only from your user account, you must also remove the read permissions for users other than yourself from the following files:

* For WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile: **wlp/usr/servers/<server>/server.xml**
* For Apache Tomcat: **conf/server.xml**

### Step 4
{: #step-4 }
Replace the placeholder values for the properties at the beginning of the file.

**Note:**  
The following special characters must be escaped when they are used in the values of the Ant XML scripts:

* The dollar sign (`$`) must be written as $$, unless you explicitly want to reference an Ant variable through the syntax `${variable}`, as described in Properties section of the Apache Ant Manual.
* The ampersand character (`&`) must be written as `&amp;`, unless you explicitly want to reference an XML entity.
* Double quotation marks (`"`) must be written as `&quot;`, except when it is inside a string that is enclosed in single quotation marks.

### Step 5
{: #step-5 }
Run the command: `ant -f configure-file.xml install`

This command installs your {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }} components in the application server.
To install updated {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }} components, for example if you apply a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} fix pack, run the following command: `ant -f configure-file.xml minimal-update`.

To reverse the installation step, run the command: `ant -f configure-file.xml uninstall`

This command uninstalls the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Services and {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console }} components.
