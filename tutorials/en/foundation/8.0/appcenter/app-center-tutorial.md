## Overview
{: #overview }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_app_center_full }} is a **repository of mobile applications** similar to public app stores but focused on the needs of an organization or a team. It is a private app store.

Application Center facilitates sharing mobile applications:

* You can **share feedback and rating** information.  
* You can use access control lists to limit who can install applications.

Application Center works with {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} apps and non-{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} apps, and supports any **iOS, Android**, **BlackBerry 6/7**, and **Windows/Phone 8.x** applications.

> **Note:** Archive/IPA files generated using Test Flight or iTunes Connect for store submission/validation of iOS apps, might cause a runtime crash/fail, read the blog [Preparing iOS apps for App Store submission in IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2016/10/17/prepare-ios-apps-for-app-store-submission/), to know more.

You can use Application Center in different contexts. For example:

* As an enterprise app store across an organization.
* During development to distribute applications within a team.

> **Note:** to build the iOS AppCenter Installer application, MobileFirst 7.1 is required.

## Installing and configuring
{: #installing-and-configuring }
Application Center is installed as part of the installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with IBM Installation Manager.

**Prerequisite:** Before you install Application Center, you must have installed an application server and a database:

* Application server: Tomcat or WebSphere  Application Server full profile or Liberty profile
* Database: DB2 , Oracle, or MySQL

If you do not have a database installed, the installation process can also install an Apache Derby database. However, using the Derby database is not recommended for production scenarios.

1. IBM Installation Manager guides you through the installation of Application Center with choices of database and application server.

    > For more information, see the topic about [installing {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](../../installation-configuration).

    Because iOS 7.1 supports only the https protocol, the Application Center server must be secured with SSL (at least with TLS v.1) if you plan to distribute apps for devices that run iOS 7.1 or later. Self-signed certificates are not recommended, but can be used for testing purposes, provided that self-signed CA certificates are distributed to devices.

2. After Application Center is installed with IBM Installation Manager, open the console: `http://localhost:9080/appcenterconsole`

3. Log in with this user/password combination: demo/demo

4. At this point, you can configure user authentication. For example, you can connect to an LDAP repository.

    > For more information, see the topic about [configuring the Application Center after installation](../../installation-configuration/production/appcenter/#configuring-application-center-after-installation).

5. Prepare the mobile client for Android, iOS, BlackBerry 6/7, and Windows Phone 8

The mobile client is the mobile application that you use to browse the catalog and install the application.

> **Note:** For a production installation, consider to install the Application Center by running the provided Ant tasks: it enables you to decouple updates to the server from updates to the Application Center.

## Cordova based IBM AppCenter client
{: #cordova-based-ibm-appcenter-client }
The Cordova based AppCenter client project is located in the `install` directory at: **install_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/CordovaAppCenterClient**.

This project is based solely on the Cordova framework and thus has no dependency on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} client/server APIs.  
Since this a standard Cordova app, there is also no dependency on {{ site.data.keys.mf_studio }}. This app uses Dojo for the UI.

Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Install Cordova.

```bash
npm install -g cordova@latest
```

2. Install Android SDK and set the `ANDROID_HOME`.  
3. Build and run this project.

Build all platforms:

```bash
cordova build
```

Build only Android:

```bash
cordova build android
```

Build only iOS:

```bash
cordova build ios
```

### Customizing AppCenter Installer application
{: #customizing-appcenter-installer-application }
You can further customize the application, such as updating its user interface for your specific company or needs.

> **Note:** While you can freely customize the application UI and behavior, such changes are not under the support agreement by IBM.

#### Android
{: #android }
* Open the Android Studio.
* Select **Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)**
* Select the android folder from **install_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/CordovaAppCenterClient/platforms/android**.

This might take some time. Once this is done you are ready to customize.

> **Note:** Select to skip the update option on the popup window, for upgrading the gradle version. Refer to `grade-wrapper.properties` for the version.

#### iOS
{: #ios }
* Go to **install_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/CordovaAppCenterClient/platforms**.
* Click to open the **IBMAppCenterClient.xcodeproj** file, the project is opened in Xcode and you are ready to customize.

## Preparing mobile clients
{: #preparing-mobile-clients }
### For Android phones and tablets
{: #for-android-phones-and-tablets }
The mobile client is delivered as a compiled application (APK) and is located at **install_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenter.apk**

> **Note:** Refer to [Cordova based IBM AppCenter client](#cordova-based-ibm-appcenter-client), if you are using Cordova framework for building Android and iOS AppCenter client.

### For iPad and iPhone
{: #for-ipad-and-iphone }
1. Compile and sign the client application provided in source code. This is mandatory.

2. In MobileFirst Studio, open the IBMAppCenter Project at: **install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer**

3. Use **Run As → Run on MobileFirst Development Server** to build the project.

4. Use Xcode to build and sign the application with your Apple iOS Enterprise profile.  
You can either open the resulting native project (in **iphone\native**) manually in Xcode, or right-click the iPhone folder and select **Run As → Xcode project**. This action generats the project and opens it in Xcode.

> **Note:** Refer to [Cordova based IBM AppCenter client](#cordova-based-ibm-appcenter-client), if you are using Cordova framework for building Android and iOS AppCenter client.

### For Blackberry
{: #for-blackberry }
* To build the BlackBerry version, you must have the BlackBerry Eclipse IDE (or Eclipse with the BlackBerry Java plug-in) with the BlackBerry SDK 6.0. The application also runs on BlackBerry OS 7 when compiled with BlackBerry SDK 6.0.

A BlackBerry project is provided in: **install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMAppCenterBlackBerry6**

### For Windows Phone 8
{: #for-windows-phone-8}
1.  Register a company account with Microsoft.  
Application Center manages only company applications that are signed with the company certificate that comes with your company account.

2. The Windows Phone version of the mobile client is included at: **install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenterUnsigned.xap**

* Make sure that also the Application Center mobile client is signed with this company certificate.

* To install company applications on a device, first enroll the device with the company by installing a company enrollment token.

> For more information about company accounts and enrollment tokens, see the [Microsoft Developer website → Company app distribution for Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx) page.

> For more information about how to sign Windows Phone mobile client applications, see the [Microsoft Developer website](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop).

<br/>

> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> **Important:**  You **cannot** use the unsigned `.xap` file directly. Before you can install it on a device, you must first sign it with your company certificate, which you obtained from Symantec or Microsoft.

### For Windows Store Apps for Windows 8.1 Pro
{: #for-windows-store-apps-for-windows-81-pro }
* The **install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenterWindowsStore.zip** file contains the executable of the Application Center client. Distribute this file to the client computer and unzip it. It contains the executable program.

* Installing a Windows Store app (a file of type `appx`) without using Microsoft Windows Store is called <em>sideloading</em> an app. To sideload an app, you must comply with the prerequisites in [Prepare to sideload apps](https://technet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/dn613842.aspx). The Windows 8.1.1 update simplifies the prerequisites for sideloading. For more information, see [Sideloading Store Apps to Windows 8.1.1 Devices]( http://blogs.msdn.com/b/micham/archive/2014/05/30/sideloading-store-apps-to-windows-8-1-devices.aspx).

## Managing applications in the Application Center console

![Reviews]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/reviewss.png)

## Application Center command-line tools
{: #application-center-command-line-tools }
The **install_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools** directory contains all the files that are required to use the command-line tool or Ant tasks to manage the applications in the store:

* `applicationcenterdeploytool.jar`: the upload command-line tool.
* `json4jar`: the library for the JSON format that is required by the upload tool.
* `build.xml`: a sample Ant script that you can use to upload a single file or a sequence of files to Application Center.
* `acdeploytool.sh` and `acdeploytool.bat`: Simple scripts to call Java with the `applicationcenterdeploytool.jar` file.

For example, to deploy an application `app.apk` file to the store in `localhost:9080/applicationcenter` with user ID `demo` and password `demo`, write:

```bash
Java com.ibm.appcenter.Upload -s http://localhost:9080 -c applicationcenter -u demo -p demo app.apk
```
