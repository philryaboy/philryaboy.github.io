## Overview
{: #overview }
In order to send push or SMS notifications to iOS, Android or Windows devices, the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} first needs to be configured with the FCM details for Android, an APNS certificate for iOS or WNS credentials for Windows 8.1 Universal / Windows 10 UWP.
Notifications can then be sent to: all devices (broadcast), devices that registered to specific tags, a single Device ID,  User Ids, only iOS devices, only Android devices, only Windows devices, or based on the authenticated user.

**Prerequisite**: Make sure to read the [Notifications overview](../) tutorial.

## Setting up Notifications
{: #setting-up-notifications }
Enabling notifications support involves several configuration steps in both {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} and the client application.  
Continue reading for the server-side setup, or jump to [Client-side setup](#tutorials-to-follow-next).

On the server-side, required set-up includes: configuring the needed vendor (APNS, FCM or WNS) and mapping the "push.mobileclient" scope.

### Firebase Cloud Messaging
{: #firebase-cloud-messaging }
> **Note:** Google has [deprecated GCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/faq) and has integrated Cloud Messaging with Firebase. If you are using a GCM project, ensure that you [migrate the GCM client apps on Android to FCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/android-migrate-fcm) .

Android devices use the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service for push notifications.  
To setup FCM:

1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1).
2. Create a new project and provide a project name.
3. Click on the Settings "cog wheel" icon and select **Project settings**.
4. Click the **Cloud Messaging** tab to generate a **Server API Key** and a **Sender ID** and click **Save**.

> You can also setup FCM using either the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Push service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/r_restapi_push_gcm_settings_put.html#Push-GCM-Settings--PUT-) or the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/apiref/r_restapi_update_gcm_settings_put.html#restservicesapi)

#### Notes
{: #notes }
If your organization has a firewall that restricts the traffic to or from the Internet, you must go through the following steps:  

* Configure the firewall to allow connectivity with FCM in order for your FCM client apps to receive messages.
* The ports to open are 5228, 5229, and 5230. FCM typically uses only 5228, but it sometimes uses 5229 and 5230.
* FCM does not provide specific IP, so you must allow your firewall to accept outgoing connections to all IP addresses contained in the IP blocks listed in Google’s ASN of 15169.
* Ensure that your firewall accepts outgoing connections from {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to android.googleapis.com on port 443.

### Apple Push Notifications Service
{: #apple-push-notifications-service }
iOS devices use Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS) for push notifications.  
To setup APNS:

1. Generate a push notification certificate for development or production. For detailed steps, refer the `For iOS` section [here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/push_step_1.html#push_step_1). 
2. In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Push Settings**, select the certificate type and provide the certificate's file and password. Then, click **Save**.

#### Notes
{: #notes-apns }
* For push notifications to be sent, the following servers must be accessible from a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instance:  
    * Sandbox servers:  
        * gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195
        * feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com:2196
    * Production servers:  
        * gateway.push.apple.com:2195
        * Feedback.push.apple.com:2196
        * 1-courier.push.apple.com 5223
* During the development phase, use the apns-certificate-sandbox.p12 sandbox certificate file.
* During the production phase, use the apns-certificate-production.p12 production certificate file.
    * The APNS production certificate can only be tested once the application that utilizes it has been successfully submitted to the Apple App Store.

**Note:** MobileFirst does not support Universal certificates.

> You can also setup APNS using either the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Push service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/r_restapi_push_apns_settings_put.html#Push-APNS-settings--PUT-) or the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/apiref/r_restapi_update_apns_settings_put.html?view=kc)

<img class="gifplayer" alt="Image of adding the APNS credentials" src="apns-setup.png"/>

### Windows Push Notifications Service
{: #windows-push-notifications-service }
Windows devices use the Windows Push Notifications Service (WNS) for push notifications.  
To setup WNS:

1. Follow the [instructions provided by Microsoft](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/apps/hh465407.aspx) to generate the **Package Security Identifier (SID)** and **Client secret** values.
2. In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Push Settings**, add these values and click **Save**.

> You can also setup WNS using either the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Push service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/r_restapi_push_wns_settings_put.html?view=kc) or the [REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/apiref/r_restapi_update_wns_settings_put.html?view=kc)

<img class="gifplayer" alt="Image of adding the WNS credentials" src="wns-setup.png"/>

### SMS Notification Service
{: #sms-notification-service }
The following JSON is used to setup the SMS gateway for sending SMS notifications. [Use the `smsConf` REST API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/r_restapi_push_sms_settings_put.html) to update the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with the SMS gateway configuration

```json
{
	"host": "2by0.com",
	"name": "dummy",
	"port": "80",
	"programName": "gateway/add.php",
	"parameters": [{
		"name": "xmlHttp",
		"value": "false",
		"encode": "true"
	}, {
		"name": "httpsEnabled",
		"value": "false",
		"encode": "true"
	}]

}
```

### Scope mapping
{: #scope-mapping }
Map the **push.mobileclient** scope element to the application.

1. Load the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} and navigate to **[your application] → Security → Scope-Elements Mapping**, click on **New**.
2. Write "push.mobileclient" in the **Scope element** field. Then, click **Add**.

### Authenticated Notifications
{: #authenticated-notifications }
Authenticated notifications are notifications that are sent to one or more `userIds`.  

Map the **push.mobileclient** scope element to the security check used for the application.  

1. Load the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} and navigate to **[your application] → Security → Scope-Elements Mapping**, click on **New** or edit an existing scope mapping entry.
2. Select a security check. Then, click **Add**.

    <img class="gifplayer" alt="Authenticated notifications" src="authenticated-notifications.png"/>

## Defining Tags
{: #defining-tags }
In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Tags**, click **New**.  
Provide the appropriate `Tag Name` and `Description` and click **Save**.

<img class="gifplayer" alt="Adding tags" src="adding-tags.png"/>

Subscriptions tie together a device registration and a tag. When a device is unregistered from a tag, all associated subscriptions are automatically unsubscribed from the device itself. In a scenario where there are multiple users of a device, subscriptions should be implemented in mobile applications based on user log-in criteria. For example, the subscribe call is made after a user successfully logs in to an application and the unsubscribe call is made explicitly as part of the logout action handling.

## Sending Notifications
{: #sending-notifications }
Push notifications can be sent either from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} or via REST APIs.

* With the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, two types of notifications can be sent: tag and broadcast.
* With the REST APIs, all forms of notifications can be sent: tag, broadcast and authenticated.

### {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}
{: #mobilefirst-operations-console }
Notifications can be sent to a single Device ID, a single or several User IDs, only iOS devices or only Android devices, or to devices subscribed to tags.

#### Tag notifications
{: #tag-notifications }
Tag notifications are notification messages that are targeted to all the devices that are subscribed to a particular tag. Tags represent topics of interest to the user and provide the ability to receive notifications according to the chosen interest.

In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Send Notifications tab**, select **Devices By Tags** from the **Send To** tab and provide the **Notification Text**. Then, click **Send**.

<img class="gifplayer" alt="Sending by tag" src="sending-by-tag.png"/>

#### Broadcast notifications
{: #breadcast-notifications }
Broadcast notifications are a form of tag push notifications that are targeted to all subscribed devices. Broadcast notifications are enabled by default for any push-enabled {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} application by a subscription to a reserved `Push.all` tag (auto-created for every device). The `Push.all` tag can be programmatically unsubscribed.

In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Send Notifications tab**, select **All** from the **Send To** tab and provide the **Notification Text**. Then, click **Send**.

![send-to-all](sending-to-all.png)

### REST APIs
{: #rest-apis }
When using the REST APIs to send notifications, all forms of notifications can be sent: tag &amp; broadcast notifications, and authenticated notifications.

To send a notification, a request is made using POST to the REST endpoint: `imfpush/v1/apps/<application-identifier>/messages`.  
Example URL:

```bash
https://myserver.com:443/imfpush/v1/apps/com.sample.PinCodeSwift/messages
```

> To review all Push Notifications REST APIs, see the [REST API Runtime Services topic](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/c_restapi_runtime.html) in the user documentation.

#### Notification payload
{: #notification-payload }
The request can contain the following payload properties:

Payload Properties| Definition
--- | ---
message | The alert message to be sent
settings | The settings are the different attributes of the notification.
target | Set of targets can be consumer Ids, devices, platforms, or tags. Only one of the targets can be set.
deviceIds | An array of the devices represented by the device identifiers. Devices with these ids receive the notification. This is a unicast notification.
notificationType | Integer value to indicate the channel (Push/SMS) used to send message. Allowed values are 1 (only Push), 2 (only SMS) and 3 (Push and SMS)
platforms | An array of device platforms. Devices running on these platforms receive the notification. Supported values are A (Apple/iOS), G (Google/Android) and M (Microsoft/Windows).
tagNames | An array of tags specified as tagNames. Devices that are subscribed to these tags receive the notification. Use this type of target for tag based notifications.
userIds | An array of users represented by their userIds to send the notification. This is a unicast notification.
phoneNumber | The phone number used for registering the device and receiving notifications. This is a unicast notification.

**Push Notifications Payload JSON Example**

```json
{
    "message" : {
    "alert" : "Test message",
  },
  "settings" : {
    "apns" : {
      "badge" : 1,
      "iosActionKey" : "Ok",
      "payload" : "",
      "sound" : "song.mp3",
      "type" : "SILENT",
    },
    "gcm" : {
      "delayWhileIdle" : ,
      "payload" : "",
      "sound" : "song.mp3",
      "timeToLive" : ,
    },
  },
  "target" : {
    // The list below is for demonstration purposes only - per the documentation only 1 target is allowed to be used at a time.
    "deviceIds" : [ "MyDeviceId1", ... ],
    "platforms" : [ "A,G", ... ],
    "tagNames" : [ "Gold", ... ],
    "userIds" : [ "MyUserId", ... ],
  },
}
```

**SMS Notification Payload JSON Example**

```json
{
  "message": {
    "alert": "Hello World from an SMS message"
  },
  "notificationType":3,
   "target" : {
     "deviceIds" : ["38cc1c62-03bb-36d8-be8e-af165e671cf4"]
   }
}
```

#### Sending the notification
{: #sending-the-notification }
The notification can be sent using different tools.  
For testing purposes, Postman is used as described below:

1. [Configure a Confidential Client](../../authentication-and-security/confidential-clients/).   
    Sending a Push Notification via the REST API uses the space-separated scope elements `messages.write` and `push.application.<applicationId>.`

    <img class="gifplayer" alt="Configure a confidential client" src="push-confidential-client.png"/>

2. [Create an access token](../../authentication-and-security/confidential-clients#obtaining-an-access-token).  


3. Make a **POST** request to **http://localhost:9080/imfpush/v1/apps/com.sample.PushNotificationsAndroid/messages**
    - If using a remote {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }}, replace the `hostname` and `port` values with your own.
    - Update the application identifier value with your own.

4. Set a Header:
    - **Authorization**: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImp ...`
    - Replace the value after "Bearer" with the value of your access token from step (1) above.

    ![authorization header](postman_authorization_header.png)

5. Set a Body:
    - Update its properties as described in [Notification payload](#notification-payload) above.
    - For example, by adding the **target** property with the **userIds** attribute, you can send a notification to specific registered users.

   ```json
   {
        "message" : {
            "alert" : "Hello World!"
        }
   }
   ```

   ![authorization header](postman_json.png)

After clicking on the **Send** button, the device should have now received a notification:

### Customizing Notifications
{: #customizing-notifications }
Before sending the notification message, you can also customize the following notification attributes.  

In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} → **[your application] → Push → Tags → Send Notifications tab**, expend the **iOS/Android Custom Settings** section to change notification attributes.

### Android
{: #android }
* Notification sound, how long a notification can be stored in the FCM storage, custom payload and more.
* If you want to change the notification title, then add `push_notification_tile` in the Android project's **strings.xml** file.

### iOS
{: #ios }
* Notification sound, custom payload, action key title, notification type and badge number.

![customizing push notifications](customizing-push-notifications.png)

## Proxy Support
{: #proxy-support }
You can make use proxy settings to set the optional proxy through which notifications are sent to Android and iOS devices. You can set the proxy by using the **push.apns.proxy.** and **push.gcm.proxy.** configuration properties. For more information, see [List of JNDI properties for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} push service](../../installation-configuration/production/server-configuration/#list-of-jndi-properties-for-mobilefirst-server-push-service).
