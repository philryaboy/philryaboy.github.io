## Overview
{: #overview }

{{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_full }} uses  **Elasticsearch 1.5x** for storing data and running search queries.  

Elasticsearch is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine that increases the speed and scale rates for data storage and exploration. Elasticsearch is used for full-text search, structured search.

Elasticsearch is used for storing all mobile and server data in JSON format in the Elasticsearch instances on the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }}.

The Elasticsearch instances are queried in real-time to populate the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_console_full }}.

{{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} exposes all Elasticsearch functionality. The user is able to take full advantage of Elasticsearch queries, debugging, and optimization.

For more information about Elasticsearch functionality, beyond the functionality described here, see the  [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.5/index.html).

## Managing Elasticsearch on the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }}
{: #managing-elasticsearch-on-the-mobilefirst-analytics-server }

Elasticsearch is embedded in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }} and participates in the node and cluster behavior.

> For more information on configuring Elasticsearch on the Analytics Server, see [Cluster management and Elasticsearch](../../installation-configuration/production/analytics/configuration#cluster-management-and-elasticsearch) in the [{{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }} Configuration Guide](../../installation-configuration/production/analytics/configuration) topic.

### Elasticsearch properties
{: #elasticsearch properties }

Elasticsearch properties are available through JNDI variables or environment entries.  
One of the more useful JNDI properties to get started with viewing the Elasticsearch data is:

```xml
<jndiEntry jndiName="analytics/http.enabled" value="true"/>
```

This JNDI property allows you to view your {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_short }} raw data in JSON format and to access your Elasticsearch instance through the port that is defined by Elasticsearch. The default port is 9500.

> **Note**: This setting is not secure and should not be enabled on a production environment.

## Elasticsearch REST API
{: #elasticsearch-rest-api }

Being able to access an Elasticsearch instance provides the ability to run custom queries, and view more detailed information about the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Search and view data**  
You can view all your data by visiting the tenant's `_search` REST endpoint.  

```
http://localhost:9500/*/_search
```

**View cluster health**  

```
http://localhost:9500/_cluster/health
```

**View information on current nodes**  

```
http://localhost:9500/_nodes
```

**View the current mappings**  

```
http://localhost:9500/*/_mapping
```

> Elasticsearch exposes many more REST endpoints. To learn more, visit the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.5/index.html).
