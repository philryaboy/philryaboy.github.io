<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial presents general development information for the Mobile Web environment.</p>
<p>Mobile Web applications run on smartphones and tablets.<br />
You can optimize the application for Mobile Web by adding or changing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the <code>mobilewebapp</code> environment folder.</p>
<h2>Optimizing for Mobile Web</h2>
<p>When you develop a Mobile Web app, network performance is a highly important optimization to think about.<br />
You can optimize network performance by implementing the following two actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use minification and concatenation to reduce the size and number of files that are used within the application. This feature is available for the following environments: Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, BlackBerry 10, Mobile Web and Desktop Browser.</li>
<li>Use HTML 5 Application Cache.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>
For more information about minification and concatenation, see the topic about optimizing MobileFirst applications, in the user documentation.
