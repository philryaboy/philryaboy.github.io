Starting with version 7.0, IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation supports a new security model based on the OAuth standard. A new client API is provided to conform to this new security model.</p>
<p>To support backward compatibility, the Classic (pre-v7.0) MobileFirst security model is still in use in the flows that are based on the existing MobileFirst APIs.</p>
