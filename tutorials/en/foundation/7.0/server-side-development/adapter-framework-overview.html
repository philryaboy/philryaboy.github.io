<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial presents how to develop server-side code (adapters) that is used to transfer and retrieve information from back-end systems to client applications and cloud services. MobileFirst Server processes the information and handles security. You can write adapters in JavaScript or Java.</p>
<p>This tutorial covers the following topics:</p>

<h2 id="benefitsOfUsingAdapters">Benefits of using adapters</h2>
<h4>Universality</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapters support multiple integration technologies and back-end information systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Read-only and transactional capabilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapters support read-only and transactional access modes to back-end systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fast development</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapters use simple XML syntax and are easily configured with JavaScript API or Java API.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Security</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapters use flexible authentication facilities to create connections with back-end systems.</li>
<li>Adapters offer control over the identity of the connected user.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<ul>
<li>Data that is retrieved from back-end applications is exposed in a uniform manner, regardless of the adapter type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits specific to Java adapters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to fully control the URL structure, the content types, the request and response headers, content and encoding
    </li>
<li>Easy and fast development and testing by using MobileFirst Studio or the command-line interface (CLI)</li>
<li>Ability to test the adapter without MobileFirst Studio or CLI, by using a 3rd-party tool such as Postman</li>
<li>Easy and fast deployment to a running MobileFirst Server instance with no compromise on performance and no downtime</li>
<li>Security integration with the MobileFirst security model with no additional customization, by using simple annotations in the source code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="JavaScriptAdapers">JavaScript adapters</h2>
<p>JavaScript adapters provide templates for connection to various back-ends, such as HTTP, SQL, Cast Iron, SAP JCo, and SAP Netweaver. JavaScript adapters also provide a service discovery wizard, which you can use to autogenerate adapters for connecting to WSDL services and more.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of JavaScript adapters</h3>
<p>Each adapter consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>An XML file, which describes the connectivity options and lists the procedures that are exposed to the application or other adapters</li>
<li>A JavaScript file, which contains the implementation of procedures that are declared in the XML file</li>
<li>Zero, one, or more XSL files, which contain a transformation scheme for retrieved raw XML data</li>
</ul>
<p>Data that is retrieved by an adapter can be returned raw or preprocessed by the adapter itself. In either case, it is presented to the application as a <strong>JSON object</strong>.</p>
<h3>JavaScript adapter procedures</h3>
<p>Procedures are declared in XML and are implemented with server-side JavaScript, for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide adapter functions to the application</li>
<li>To call back-end services to retrieve data or to perform actions</li>
</ul>
<p>By using server-side JavaScript, a procedure can process the data before or after it calls the service.<br />
You can apply more filtering to retrieved data by using simple XSLT code.</p>
<p>JavaScript adapter procedures are implemented in JavaScript. However, because an adapter is a server-side entity, it is possible to use Java in the adapter code.</p>
<h3>XML structure of JavaScript adapters</h3>
<p>{% highlight xml  %} 
<wl:adapter name="HelloWorld">
    <displayName />
    <description />
    <connectivity>
        <connectionPolicy>
            ...
            <loadConstraints>
                ...
    </connectivity>

    <procedure />
    <procedure />
    ...
</wl:adapter>
{% endhighlight %} </p>
<ul>
<li><code>name: Mandatory. The name of the adapter</code></li>
<li><code>displayName</code>: Optional. The name that is displayed in the MobileFirst Console</li>
<li><code>description</code>: Optional. Additional information that is displayed in the MobileFirst Console</li>
<li><code>connectivity</code>:
<ul>
<li>Defines the connection properties and load constraints of the back-end system.</li>
<li>When the back-end system requires user authentication, defines how user credentials are obtained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>procedure</code>: Declares a service for accessing a back-end application. One entry for each adapter procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% highlight xml  %}
<procedure name="procedure1"></procedure>
<procedure name="procedure2"></procedure>
{% endhighlight %} </p>
<h3>Structure of a JavaScript adapter procedure</h3>
<p>Each procedure that is declared in the adapter XML file must have a corresponding function in the JavaScript file.<br />
The <code>WL.Server</code> API defines a procedure logic in JavaScript.</p>
<p>
{% highlight javascript  %}
function procedure1(param) {
    return WL.Server.invokeSQLStatement({
        preparedStatement: procedure1Statement,
        parameters: [param]
    });
}
{% endhighlight %} </p>
<h2 id="JavaAdapters">Java adapters</h2>
<p>Java adapters expose a full REST API to the client and are written in Java. This type of adapters is based on the <a href="https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0-rev-a/apidocs/index.html">JAX-RS specification</a>.</p>
<p>In Java adapters, it is up to the developer to define the returned content and its format, as well as the URL structure of each resource.<br />
The only exception is if the client sending the request supports GZip, then the returned content encoding of the Java adapter is compressed by GZip.</p>
<p>All operations on the returned content are done and owned by the developer.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of Java adapters</h3>
<p>Each adapter consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>An XML configuration file, which states the Java class used by adapter</li>
<li><code>lib</code> - A folder for including optional 3rd-party libraries</li>
<li><code>src/com/package-name</code> - A folder that contains the Java adapter implementation</li>
</ul>
<h3>XML structure of a Java adapter </h3>
<p>The XML configuration file configures the class name of the JAX-RS application for the adapter.</p>
<p>{% highlight xml  %}
<wl:adapter name="HelloWorld"
    <displayName />
    <description />
    <connectivity>
        <connectionPolicy xsi:type="wl:NullConnectionPolicyType"></connectionPolicy>
    </connectivity></p>
    <JAXRSApplicationClass>com.acme.HelloWorldAdapterApp</JAXRSApplicationClass>
</wl:adapter>
{% endhighlight %}
<ul>
<li><code>connectivity</code>:
<ul>
<li>Defines the connection properties and load constraints of the back-end system.</li>
<li>When the back-end system requires user authentication, defines how user credentials are obtained.</li>
<li><code>NullConnectionPolicy</code> - Default. Means that for Java adapters, the XML configuration file is not used to define the connectivity of the adapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>JAXRSApplicationClass</code>: The class name of the JAX-RS application for this adapter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Java adapter implementation class</h3>
<p>The <code>src</code> folder is generated with a JAX-RS resource file and a JAX-RS application class file.</p>
<h4>JAX-RS application class</h4>
<p>The JAX-RS application class tells the JAX-RS framework which resources are included in the JAX-RS application of the adapter.</p>
<h4>JAX-RS resource file</h4>
<p>A JAX-RS resource is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) which is mapped to a root URL and has Java methods for serving requests to this root URL and its sub URLs.</p>
<p>For more information about the Java adapter implementation class and resource file, see <a href="../../server-side-development/java-adapter/">the tutorial for Java Adapter</a>.</p>
