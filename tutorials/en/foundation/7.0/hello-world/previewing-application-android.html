<h2 id="understand">Understanding the Android native project</h2>
<p>After you add the Android environment, an Android project is generated and added to the workspace.<br />
This project folder does not contain a copy of the application code. Rather, it is mapped to the native folder within the android folder of the application.</p>
<h2 id="preview">Previewing the application in the Android Emulator</h2>
<h3>CLI</h3>
<p>If you are not using MobileFirst Studio's Eclipse plug-in, use Android Studio to navigate to the application folder in order to open it.</p>
<h3>MobileFirst Studio</h3>
<p>Before you can run the Android application in the Android Emulator (or AVD, Android Virtual Device), you must create a virtual device <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html"> by following the Android documentation.</a></p>
<p>When an AVD is available, right-click the automatically generated Android project and select <strong>Run As > Android Application</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="run">Running the application in a physical device</h2>
<p>When an Android device is connected to the computer with a USB cable, the Eclipse ADT plug-in automatically recognizes the Android device and attempts to deploy applications onto it when you right-click the automatically generated Android Project and select <strong>Run As > Android Application</strong>.</p>
