<li><a href="#openXcode">Opening the Xcode project in Xcode</a></li>

<h2 id="openXcode">Opening the Xcode project in Xcode</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Eclipse IDE <strong>does not support</strong> iOS application development. Therefore, you must transfer the application to Xcode, Apple's IDE for iOS development.</p>
<h4>CLI</h4>
<p>If you are not using MobileFirst Studio, navigate to the application folder and open the <code>.xcoeproj</code> file</p>
<h4>Studio</h4>
<p>If you are running a Mac version of Eclipse, right-click the iPhone or iPad environment folder and select <strong>Run As > Xcode project</strong>. The MobileFirst Studio plug-in builds and deploys the application and opens the Xcode project in Xcode.</p>

<li>As an alternative, you can manually open an Xcode project from the native folder.<br />
If you are running a Windowsâ„¢ version of Eclipse, manually compress the native folder and copy it to your Mac computer. The native folder represents a fully compatible native Xcode project.</p>
<h2 id="preview">Previewing the application in the iOS Simulator</h2>
<p>After opening the generated Xcode project in Xcode, select a simulator type and click <strong>Play</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="run">Running the application in a physical device</h2>
<p>To deploy an iOS application to a real device, you must enroll to the Apple iOS Developer Program and install a provisioning profile onto Xcode and your iOS device.</p>
<p>For more information, see the Apple iOS Dev Center website.</p>
<p>After you have enrolled as an iOS developer and installed a profile, select the device and click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>
