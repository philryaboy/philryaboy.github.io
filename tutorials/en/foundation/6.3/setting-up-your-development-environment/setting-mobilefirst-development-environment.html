<li>Deploy MobileFirst adapters to the embedded MobileFirst Server</li>
<li>Test MobileFirst adapter procedures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Downloading Eclipse and MobileFirst Platform Studio</h2>
<p>Before you install MobileFirst Studio you must install Eclipse. Instructions for installing a supported version of eclipse and the MobileFirst Studio plug-in are included with the IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation Developer Edition:</p>

<h4 style="color: black;">Workspace</h4>
<p>The term <em>workspace</em> is used to describe the environment where all of your work is done. The workspace contains the menu bar, toolbars, and one or more perspectives.</p>
<h4 style="color: blue;">Menubar and toolbar</h4>
<p>Comply with typical graphical user interface (GUI) applications. Provide the commands to perform standard tasks such as saving and editing files.</p>
<h4 style="color: red;">Perspectives</h4>
<p>A perspective is a special layout of particular views and tools that you need to use in your work. The currently open perspective occupies most of the Eclipse workbench. You can have more than one perspective open at a time, but only the active one is visible. You can access other open perspectives by using the toolbar on the upper-right side of the workbench.</p>
<h4 style="color: orange;">Views</h4>
<p>Views are designed to support interaction with information in your workbench. Eclipse is extensible, so that views can be designed to show nearly any information. Most common views are views of the file system, program output, and text files (generally dealt with in a special view called an editor). To add a view, select <strong>Window > Show View</strong>.</p>
<h4 style="color: green;">Editors</h4>
<p>Editors are a special view, which is designed for viewing and editing data. One of the most common uses of an editor is for editing source code.</p>
<h4>Encoding</h4>
<p>If you are working on a Windows platform, before you begin to create projects and work with your Eclipse installation, go to <strong>Window > Preferences > General > Workspace</strong>, and change the text file encoding to UTF-8.</p>
