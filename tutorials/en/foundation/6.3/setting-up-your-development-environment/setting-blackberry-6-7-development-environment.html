<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pre-requisite: if you intend on using the IBM MobileFirst Studio to develop your application, please read the Setting up your IBM MobileFirst development environment tutorial before proceeding.</p>
<p>Before starting to develop, deploy and test your BlackBerry applications, several steps are required for setting up the BlackBerry development environment. These include: installing the BlackBerry SDK, Ripple web emulator and BlackBerry Simulator.</p>
<p>BlackBerry WebWorks SDK requires a 32-bit Java™ Development Kit (JDK), version 1.6 or later, to be installed on the development<br />
host.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your BlackBerry WebWorks SDK and your Java™ Development Kit (JDK) are installed in a path that includes no spaces. For example, do not use "Program Files" or any other path that contains spaces.</p>
<h2>BlackBerry 6 and 7 development tools</h2>
<h3>Ripple emulator</h3>
<p>The Ripple emulator is a Google Chrome browser extension for previewing your WebWorks application before packaging.<br />
To download and install the Ripple emulator, visit <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/bbos/html5/download/">https://developer.blackberry.com/bbos/html5/download/</a>.<br />

<h3>BlackBerry SDK</h3>
<p>The BlackBerry SDK is used to package applications.<br />
To download and install this SDK, visit <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/bbos/html5/downloads/">http://developer.blackberry.com/bbos/html5/downloads/</a>.<br />

<h3>BlackBerry Simulator</h3>
<p>The BlackBerry Simulator is used to preview and debug your application in a simulated device environment.<br />
Download the simulator that is relevant to your development environment.<br />
For a list of simulators, visit <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/sites/developers/resources/simulators.html">http://us.blackberry.com/sites/developers/resources/simulators.html</a>.<br />

<h2>WebWorks development</h2>
<p>For more information about the BlackBerry WebWorks development process, see the <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/bbos/html5/documentation/getting_started_with_webworks.html">Getting Started section of the BlackBerry documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> BlackBerry 6 and 7 hybrid mobile application performance might not be on par with the latest BlackBerry 10 OS due to older embedded browser technologies and hardware. You might want to use prototypes to validate that applications meet performance targets on BlackBerry 6 and 7. When advanced performance is needed, native development is preferred.</p>
