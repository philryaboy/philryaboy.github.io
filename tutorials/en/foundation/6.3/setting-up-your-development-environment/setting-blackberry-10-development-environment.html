<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pre-requisite: if you intend on using IBM MobileFirst Studio to develop your application, please read the Setting up your IBM MobileFirst development environment tutorial before proceeding.</p>
<p>Before starting to develop, deploy and test your BlackBerry applications, several steps are required for setting up the BlackBerry development environment. These include: installing the BlackBerry SDK and BlackBerry Simulator.</p>
<p>BlackBerry WebWorks SDK requires a 32-bit Javaâ„¢ Development Kit (JDK), version 1.6 or later, to be installed on the development<br />
host.<br />
To create a BlackBerry 10 application, first define the WEBWORKS_HOME environment variable. The value of this variable must be the path to your WebWorks SDK.</p>
<h2>BlackBerry 10 development tools</h2>
<h3>BlackBerry SDK</h3>
<p>The BlackBerry SDK is used to package applications.<br />
To download and install this SDK, visit <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/downloads/">http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/downloads/</a>.

<h3>BlackBerry Simulator</h3>
<p>The BlackBerry Simulator is used to preview and debug your application in a simulated device environment.<br />
Download the simulator that is relevant to your development environment.<br />
For a list of simulators, visit <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/sites/developers/resources/simulators.html">http://us.blackberry.com/sites/developers/resources/simulators.html</a>.<br />

<h2>WebWorks development</h2>
<p>For more information about the BlackBerry WebWorks development process, see the <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/v2_1/getting_started.html">Getting Started section of the BlackBerry documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> BlackBerry 6 and 7 hybrid mobile application performance might not be on par with the latest BlackBerry 10 OS due to older embedded browser technologies and hardware. You might want to use prototypes to validate that applications meet performance targets on BlackBerry 6 and 7. When advanced performance is needed, native development is preferred.</p>
