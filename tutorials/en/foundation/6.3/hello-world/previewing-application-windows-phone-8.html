<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial the following topics will be covered.<br />
As a pre-requisite, make sure to read the "Previewing your application's web resources" tutorial.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Opening the Visual Studio project in Visual Studio Express 2012</li>
    <li>Preview the application in the Windows Phone 8 Emulator</li>
    <li>Run the application in a physical device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening the Visual Studio project in Visual Studio Express 2012</h2>
<p>To open a Visual Studio project from the native folder, right-click the windowsphone8\native\ .csproj file and then select Open.</p>

<p>As an alternative, you can manually open the .csproj file within Microsoft Visual Studio.<br />
Click Open Project on the left menu and navigate to the project folder.</p>

<p>If you are running Eclipse in Windows 8, you can also right-click the Windows Phone 8 project file and select <strong>Run As > Visual Studio project</strong>. The MobileFirst Studio plug-in will then build &amp; deploy the application to MobileFirst Server and automatically open the project in Visual Studio.</p>
