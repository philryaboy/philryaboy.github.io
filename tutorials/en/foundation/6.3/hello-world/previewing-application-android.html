<p>In this tutorial the following topics are covered.<br />
As a pre-requisite, read the "Previewing your application's web resources" tutorial.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Understanding the Android native project</li>
    <li>Preview the application in the Android Emulator</li>
    <li>Run the application in a physical device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Android native project</h2>
<p>After adding the Android environment, an Android project is generated and added to the workspace.<br />
This project folder does not contain a copy of the application code. Rather, it is mapped to the native folder within the android folder of the application.</p>

<h2>Preview the application in the Android Emulator</h2>
<p>Before you are able to run the Android application in the Android Emulator (or AVD, Android Virtual Device), you must create one <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html">by following the Android documentation</a></p>

<p>When an AVD is available, right-click the automatically generated Android Project, and select <strong>Run As > Android Application</strong>.</p>

<h2>Run the application in a physical device</h2>
<p>When an Android device is connected to the computer with a USB cable, the Eclipse ADT plug-in automatically recognizes the Android device and attempts to deploy applications onto it when following the same steps: right-click the automatically generated Android Project, and select <strong>Run As > Android Application</strong>.</p>
