<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial the following topics are covered.<br />
As a pre-requisite, make sure to read the "Previewing your application's web resources" tutorial.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Open the Xcode project in Xcode</li>
    <li>Preview the application in the iOS Simulator</li>
    <li>Run the application in a physical device</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening the Xcode project in Xcode</h2>
<p>The Eclipse IDE <em>does not support</em> iOS application development. Therefore, the application must be transferred to Xcode, the Apple native IDE.</p>

<p>If you are running a Mac version of Eclipse, right-click the iPhone or iPad environment folder and select <strong>Run As > Xcode project</strong>. The MobileFirst Studio plug-in builds and deploys the application as well as opens the Xcode project in Xcode.</p>

<p>As an alternative you can manually open an Xcode project from your application native folder.<br />
If you are running a Windowsâ„¢ version of Eclipse, manually compress the native folder and copy it to your Mac machine. The native folder represents a fully compatible native Xcode project.</p>

<h2>Preview the application in the iOS Simulator</h2>
<p>After opening the generated Xcode project in Xcode, select a simulator type and click <strong>Play</strong>.</p>

<h2>Run the application in a physical device</h2>
<p>To deploy an iOS application to a real device, you must enroll to the Apple iOS Developer Program and install a provisioning profile onto Xcode and your iOS device.</p>

<p>For more information, see the Apple iOS Dev Center website.</p>

<p>After the above has been set-up, select the device and click <strong>Play</strong>.</p>
