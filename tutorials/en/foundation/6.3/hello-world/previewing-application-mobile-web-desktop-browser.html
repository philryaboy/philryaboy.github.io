<h2>Preview the application in the Mobile Web Simulator</h2>
<p>The desktop browser web page is, in fact, a web page, and thus it is not displayed in the Mobile Browser Simulator. Instead, a new tab opens up and presents the web page.</p>

<h2>Run the application in a physical device</h2>
<p>To get the URL of a mobile web application, click the <strong>Get App URL</strong> link that is next to the <strong>Mobile Web</strong> icon.<br />
Copy the regular or shortened URL from the pop-up window, or use the QR code.<br />
To provide a shortened URL, your bit.ly account username and password must be provided in worklight.properties.<br />
Enter the shortened URL in your deviceâ€™s mobile browser.</p>
