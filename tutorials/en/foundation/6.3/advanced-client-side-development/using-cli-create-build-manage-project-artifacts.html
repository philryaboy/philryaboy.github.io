<p>The CLI installer adds the installation folder to your <code>path</code>, so that IBM MobileFirst Platform CLI commands can be run from any directory.</p>
<p>Create a MobileFirst project from the CLI by using either of these commands:<br />
<code>mobilefirst create projectName</code>, or <code>mfp create projectName</code><br />
<strong>Example:</strong><br />
{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample $ mfp create projectName
A MobileFirst Project was successfully created at /Users/CLIUser/CLIexample/projectName
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Helpful Commands</h3>

{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample/myProject $ mfp add environment
[?] Which hybrid app would you want to add environments? (Use arrow keys)

<li>Example - <code>vim myAdapterName</code></li>

<h2 id="testServers">Creating test servers and the build-and-deploy flow</h2>
<p>The instance of the Liberty development server is created on the default user directory. For example:<br />
<strong>/Users/CLIUser/.ibm/mobilefirst/6.3.0/server</strong></p>

<p><code>mfp build</code> - Builds the project. When you are not in the root directory of the project, this command builds the current directory and subdirectories.</p>
<p><code>mfp deploy</code> - Deploys anything that you built in the root directory of the project. The server will be automatically created and started as needed. When you are in the adapter folder, this command deploys that adapter.</p>
<p><code>mfp bd</code> - Builds and deploys (a combination of both commands in a single command).</p>
<p><code>mfp preview [environments-name --noshell|-n]</code>  - Displays a preview of the current application or environment in your default browser.</p>

<h2 id="export">Using the Export command</h2>
<h3>Interactive Mode project export</h3>
<p>By using the <code>export</code> command, you can create a compressed file, which contains the entire MobileFirst project, or the optimized hybrid assets to use in a native application.</p>
<p><code>mfp export</code> - Running this command in the project root folder prompts you to enter the path and name of the compressed file to export to.<br />
The resulting compressed file is intended to be shared with other MobileFirst developers. The compressed file contains source artifacts and everything another developer would need to build the missing artifacts.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample/projectName $ mfp export
[?] Where do you want to export the project? /Users/CLIUser/Desktop
[?] What do you want to name your zip project? projectName
Project successfully exported to /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/projectName.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Direct Mode project export</h3>
<p><code>mfp export [<path to zip file>]</code> - If run from the root folder of the project, direct mode takes one additional argument, which is the full path to the compressed file to create.</p>
    
{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample/projectName $ mfp export /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/myProject.zip
Project successfully exported to /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/myProject.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Interactive Mode hybrid export</h3>
<p>First make sure that the app is built by using the <code>mfp build</code> command.<br />
Run the hybrid asset export within the environment folder of the existing hybrid app. Interactive mode asks whether to include the native libraries, the path, and file name of the compressed file to export to.<br />
The native libraries are built files, which native application IDEs need to ensure the hybrid assets can be used in a native app.<br />

{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample/projectName/apps/myHybrid/iphone $ mfp export
[?] Would you like to include the native libraries? Yes
[?] Where do you want to export the project? /Users/CLIUser/Desktop
[?] What do you want to name your zip project? myProjectName.zip
Project successfully exported to /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/myProjectName.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Direct Mode hybrid export</h3>
<p><code>mfp export [path to zip file] [-i | --includeNativeLibs]</code> - In direct mode, provide the full path to export hybrid assets. If the arguments <code>-i</code> or <code>--includeNativeLibs</code> are supplied, the native libraries are included.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
~/CLIexample/projectName/apps/myHybrid/iphone $ mfp export /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/projectName.zip --includeNativeLibs
Project successfully exported to /Users/CLIUser/Desktop/projectName.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="import">Importing CLI-generated projects into MobileFirst Platform Studio</h2>
<p>From Eclipse, select <strong>File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/existingProj.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/import.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/eclipseProj.png"/></p>
<p>CLI can also open an existing MobileFirst Studio Eclipse project. Using the command line, navigate to a workspace that was created by Eclipse.</p>
    
{% highlight bash %}
~/Users/CLIUser/Desktop/EclipseWorkspace/projectName $ ls
adapters    bin     externalServerLibraries services
apps      components    server
{% endhighlight %}
