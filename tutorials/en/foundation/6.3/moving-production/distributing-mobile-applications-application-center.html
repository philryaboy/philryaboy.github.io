<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The IBM MobileFirst Platform Application Center is a <strong>repository of mobile applications</strong> similar to public app stores but focused on the needs of an organization or a team (private app store)</p>
<p>It facilitates sharing mobile applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        You can <strong>share feedback and rating</strong> information.
    </li>
<li>
        You can use access control lists to limit who can install applications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It works with IBM MobileFirst and non IBM MobileFirst apps, and supports any <strong>iOS, Android, BlackBerry 6 or 7</strong>, and <strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> applications.</p>
<p>It can be used in different contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        As an enterprise app store across an organization.
    </li>
<li>
        During development to distribute applications within a team.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installAndConfig">Installing and configuring</h2>
<p>The Application Center is installed as part of the installation of the MobileFirst Platform Server with IBM Installation Manager.</p>
<p>Before you install the Application Center, you must have installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        An application server (Tomcat or WebSphere  Application Server [full or Liberty profile])
    </li>
<li>
        A database (DB2 , Oracle, or MySQL)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a database installed, the installation can also install an Apache Derby database. But, using this database is not recommended for production scenarios.</p>
<p>IBM Installation Manager guides you through the installation of the Application Center with choices of database and application server. Fore more information, see <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZH4A_6.2.0/com.ibm.worklight.installconfig.doc/admin/c_installation.html">Installing MobileFirst Server</a> in the IBM MobileFirst Platform product documentation.</p>
<p>Since iOS 7.1 supports only https, the Application Center server must be secured with SSL if you plan to distribute apps for devices running iOS 7.1. Self signed certificates do not work; only real SSL certificates work. See the topic <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZH4A_6.2.0/com.ibm.worklight.installconfig.doc/appcenter/c_ac_ssl_config.html">Configure Secure Sockets Layer</a> in the IBM MobileFirst Platform product documentation.</p>
<p>After the Application Center is installed with IBM Installation Manager, open the console using:</p>
<p>http://localhost:9080/appcenterconsole</p>
<p>Login with user / password : <strong>demo</strong> / <strong>demo</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you can configure user authentication. For example, you can connect to an LDAP repository. For more information, see <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZH4A_6.2.0/com.ibm.worklight.installconfig.doc/appcenter/c_configuration_of_the_applicati.html">Configuring the Application Center after installation</a> in the IBM MobileFirst Platform product documentation.</p>
<p>The next step is to prepare the mobile client for Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone 8. The mobile client is the mobile application that you use to browse the catalog and install the application.</p>
<p>For <strong>Android</strong> phones and tablets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        The mobile client is delivered as a compiled application (APK)</p>
<p>        <code><installation-dir>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenter.apk</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>iPad</strong> and <strong>iPhone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        You must compile and sign the client application provided in source code.
    </li>
<li>
        In MobileFirst Platform Studio, open the IBMAppCenter Project at:</p>
<p>        <code><installation-dir>/ApplicationCenter/installer</code>
    </li>
<li>
        Use <strong>Run As > Build and Deploy</strong> to build the project.
    </li>
<li>
        Use Xcode to build and sign the application with your Apple iOS Enterprise profile.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>Blackberry</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        To build the BlackBerry version, you must have the BlackBerry Eclipse IDE (or Eclipse with the BlackBerry Javaâ„¢ plug-in) with the BlackBerry SDK 6.0. The application also runs on BlackBerry OS 7 when compiled with BlackBerry SDK 6.0.
    </li>
<li>
        A BlackBerry project is provided in:</p>
<p>        <code><installation-dir>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMAppCenterBlackBerry6</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>Windows Phone 8</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        You must register a company account with Microsoft.
    </li>
<li>
        Application Center will only manage company applications that are signed with the company certificate that comes with your company account.
    </li>
<li>
        The Application Center mobile client must also be signed with this company certificate.
    </li>
<li>
        To install company applications on a device, the device must first be enrolled with the company by installing a company enrollment token.
    </li>
<li>
        For more information about the company accounts and enrollment tokens see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx">Company app distribution for Windows Phone</a> in the <a href="http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop">Microsoft Developer website</a>.
    </li>
<li>
        The Windows Phone version of the mobile client is included at:</p>
<p>        <code><installation-dir>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenterUnsigned.xap</code>
    </li>
<li>
        <strong>You cannot use the unsigned .xap file directly:</strong> Before you can install it on a device, you must first sign it with your company certificate that you obtained from Symantec or Microsoft.
    </li>
<li>
        For more information about how to sign the Windows Phone mobile client application, see the <a href="http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop">Microsoft Developer website</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
