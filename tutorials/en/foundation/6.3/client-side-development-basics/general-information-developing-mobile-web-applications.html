<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial a general development information for the Mobile Web environment will be presented.</p>

<p>Mobile Web applications run on smartphones and tablets.<br />
You can optimize the application for Mobile Web by adding or changing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the mobilewebapp environment folder.</p>

<h2>Optimizing for Mobile Web</h2>
<p>When developing a Mobile Web app, network performance is a highly important optimization to think about.<br />
Network performance can be optimized by implementing the following two actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use Minification and Concatenation to reduce the size and number of files that are used within the application.</li>
    <li>Use HTML 5 Application Cache</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>For more information about Minification and Concatenation, see the "Optimizing MobileFirst applications" user documentation topic</blockquote>
