<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To complete your evaluation experience of IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers, download the Wishlist sample application.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> No additional setup is required in your development computer for this evaluation. However, to run <em>applications on devices</em>, you might have to go through some prerequisite setup, such as device provisioning in Xcode. Such prerequisite steps are outside of the scope of this tutorial and of IBM MobileFirst Platform.</p>

<h2 id="sample">Wishlist sample application</h2>
    <p><img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/wishlist-app-156x300.png" align="right" /> The Wishlist application is meant for iOS, Android, or hybrid environments (iPhone, Android).<br />
    The application implements the following functionality:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fetches catalog data (a hard-coded list of items) from a web service by using the catalog adapter.</li>
        <li>Contains a secured wishlist area which allows users to save catalog items or custom items (by manually entering the item details) into a store. By default, the store uses a Cloudant database, but if it is configured otherwise, it can store data by using the local file store.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The wishlist section within the application is accessible via authentication. For demonstration purposes, use "user" and "password" as the user/password.</p>

  Hybrid sample
</a>

<div class="collapse" id="collapseHybrid">
    <div class="well">
        <h4>Open the application in your favorite IDE</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Navigate to the MobileFirstStarter\apps\WishList\iphone\native and double-click the <em>.xcodeproj</em> file.</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Open the MobileFirstStarter\apps\WishList\android\native folder in Android Studio.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="runNativeApp">Run the application</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In the container Overview page, find the Server IP address.</li>
            <li>Build and run it in the IDE of the selected environment.</li>
            <li>Run the app from Xcode/Android Studio into your device and supply the IP address in the application UI.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
