<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial goes through the steps that you must follow to evaluate running IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers: You register an account at the IBM Cloud website, you create an IBM Container that contains a preconfigured, self-contained, MobileFirst Platform Foundation "Getting Started" image, you set up this image, and finally you download a sample mobile application and run it with the MobileFirst Server instance that runs inside the Container service on IBM Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> First make sure that you read the <a href="../">Introduction to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers</a> tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="registerAccount">Registering an account on IBM Cloud</h2>
<p>If you do not have an account yet, visit the <a href="http://www.bluemix.net">IBM Cloud website</a> and click <strong>Get Started Free</strong> or <strong>Sign Up</strong> button. You must first fill out a registration form before you can move to the next step.</p>

<p><img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/bluemix-sign-up.png" /></p>

<p>After signing in to IBM Cloud, you are presented with the IBM Cloud Dashboard which provides an overview of the active IBM Cloud <strong>space</strong>. This is a work area which by default receives the name "dev". You can create multiple work areas/spaces if needed.</p>

<p>The next step is to add an <strong>IBM Container</strong> in the IBM Cloud space.</p>

<h2 id="createContainer">Creating an IBM Container</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click <strong>Start Containers</strong>.
        <img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/bluemix-create-container.png"  /></li>

    <li>In the screen that display, select the <strong>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation Getting Started</strong> image.
        <img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/select_the_image-1024x261.png"  /></li>

    <li>Provide a name for the container.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Container size (memory: "Medium")</strong>, request a public IP address, assign public ports (80, 9080).</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to create the container.

        <img alt="missing_alt" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/image_details.png"  /></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The Container page is then loaded.<br />

<strong>Note:</strong> After the page is loaded, the Container might be still in "building" stage.</p>

<p>To access the container, use the IP address that you have previously binded to it.<br />
If you haven't done so, you can still do it from the <strong>Public IP address</strong> drop-down menu.</p>

<p>The address to use is: <code>http(s)://binded-IP-address</code>.<br/>
Before you can access the container, you first go through a one-time registration page.<br />
After you have registered, the Overview page displays.</p>

<h2 id="fobOverview">IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers Overview page</h2>
<p>Use one of the sample applications to reach the final step of the evaluation: connecting an app to a MobileFirst Server instance that runs on top of IBM Cloud.</p>

<p>The landing page also provides links to various documentation resources.</p>
