<!--<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Before talking about IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation and IBM Containers, lets talk IBM Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>IBM Cloud</strong> is an implementation of IBM's Open Cloud Architecture. It leverages <strong>Cloud Foundry</strong> to enable developers to rapidly build, deploy, and manage their cloud applications, while tapping a growing ecosystem of available services and runtime frameworks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Learn more about the IBM Cloud architecture and IBM Cloud concepts <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/overview.html">on the IBM Cloud website</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the context of IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation, it is possible to take an existing Foundation-based project and run it on top of IBM Cloud: no need to maintain IT infrastructure and other traditional hurdles any more. This feature opens up the ability to implement and use various IBM Cloud-provided services to complete and enhance the feature set of a given application.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell: to run IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers, several components must interact with one another: the first component is an <strong>image</strong> that contains a <strong>Linux distribution with a WebSphere Liberty installation</strong>, with a <strong>MobileFirst Server instance</strong> deployed to it. The image is then stored inside an <strong>IBM Container</strong>, and the IBM Container is managed by <strong>IBM Cloud</strong>.</p>

<h3>IBM Containers</h3>
<p>IBM Containers are objects that are used to run images in a hosted cloud environment. IBM Containers hold everything that an app needs to run.</p>

<p>The IBM Container infrastructure includes a private registry for your images, so that you can upload, store, and retrieve them. You can make those images available for IBM Cloud to manage them. A command line interface is then used to manage your containers on IBM Cloud - More on this in the following tutorials.</p>
