title: Distributing mobile applications with Application Center
relevantTo: [ios,android,windowsphone8,windows8,hybrid]
---
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Application Center is a <strong>repository of mobile applications</strong> similar to public app stores but focused on the needs of an organization or a team (private app store).</p>
<p>Application Center facilitates sharing mobile applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        You can <strong>share feedback and rating</strong> information.
    </li>
<li>
        You can use access control lists to limit who can install applications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Application Center works with MobileFirst apps and non-MobileFirst apps, and supports any <strong>iOS, Android</strong>, <strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> applications. BlackBerry 10 is not supported.</p>
<p>You can use Application Center in different contexts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        As an enterprise app store across an organization.
    </li>
<li>
        During development to distribute applications within a team.
    </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="installAndConfig">Installing and configuring</h2>
<p>Application Center is installed as part of the installation of MobileFirst Server with IBM Installation Manager.<br />
<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Before you install Application Center, you must have installed an application server and a database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        Application server: Tomcat or WebSphere  Application Server full profile or Liberty profile
    </li>
<li>
        Database: DB2 , Oracle, or MySQL
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a database installed, the installation process can also install an Apache Derby database. However, using the Derby database is not recommended for production scenarios.</p>
<ol>
<li>IBM Installation Manager guides you through the installation of Application Center with choices of database and application server. Fore more information,<br />
<blockquote><p>For more information, see the topic about installing MobileFirst Server, in the user documentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because iOS 7.1 supports only the https protocol, the Application Center server must be secured with SSL (at least with TLS v.1) if you plan to distribute apps for devices that run iOS 7.1 or later. Self-signed certificates are not recommended, but can be used for testing purpose, provided that self-signed CA certificates are distributed to devices.</p>
<blockquote><p>For more information, see the topic about configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), in the user documentation.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>After Application Center is installed with IBM Installation Manager, open the console:
<p><code>http://localhost:9080/appcenterconsole</code>
</li>
<li>Log in with this user/password combination: <code>demo</code> / <code>demo</code></li>
<li>At this point, you can configure user authentication. For example, you can connect to an LDAP repository.<br />
<blockquote><p>For more information, see the topic about configuring the Application Center after installation, in the user documentation.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Prepare the mobile client for Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone 8, as explained in  <a href="http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSHS8R_7.1.0/com.ibm.worklight.installconfig.doc/appcenter/c_configuration_of_the_applicati.html">Preparing mobile clients</a>.<br />
The mobile client is the mobile application that you use to browse the catalog and install the application.</li>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> For a production installation, consider to install the Application Center by running the provided Ant tasks: it enables you to decouple updates to the server from updates to the Application Center. For more information, see the user documentation.</p></blockquote>
</ol>
<h2 id="clients">Preparing mobile clients</h2>
<h3>For Android phones and tablets</h3>
<p>The mobile client is delivered as a compiled application (APK).</p>
<pre><code>    <code><em>install_dir</em>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenter.apk</code>
</code></pre>
<h3>For iPad and iPhone</h3>
<ol>
<li>
        Compile and sign the client application provided in source code. This is mandatory.
    </li>
<li>
        In MobileFirst Studio, open the IBMAppCenter Project at:</p>
<p>        <code><em>install_dir</em>/ApplicationCenter/installer</code>
    </li>
<li>
        Use <strong>Run As > Run on MobileFirst Development Server</strong> to build the project.
    </li>
<li>
        Use Xcode to build and sign the application with your Apple iOS Enterprise profile.<br />
        You can either open the resulting native project (in <strong>iphone\native</strong>) manually in Xcode, or right-click the iPhone folder and select <strong>Run As > Xcode project</strong> (which will generate the project and then open it in Xcode).
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>For Blackberry</h3>
<ul>
<li>
        To build the BlackBerry version, you must have the BlackBerry Eclipse IDE (or Eclipse with the BlackBerry Javaâ„¢ plug-in) with the BlackBerry SDK 6.0. The application also runs on BlackBerry OS 7 when compiled with BlackBerry SDK 6.0.
    </li>
<li>
        A BlackBerry project is provided in:</p>
<p>        <code><em>install_dir</em>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMAppCenterBlackBerry6</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>For Windows Phone 8</h3>
<ol>
<li>Register a company account with Microsoft.<br />
Application Center manages only company applications that are signed with the company certificate that comes with your company account.
    </li>
<li>
        Make sure that also the Application Center mobile client is signed with this company certificate.
    </li>
<li>
        To install company applications on a device, first enroll the device with the company by installing a company enrollment token.</p>
<blockquote><p>For more information about company accounts and enrollment tokens, see the "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj206943(v=vs.105).aspx">Company app distribution for Windows Phone</a> page in the <a href="http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop">Microsoft Developer website.</a>
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Windows Phone version of the mobile client is included at:</p>
<p><code><em>install_dir</em>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenterUnsigned.xap</code></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>  You <strong>cannot</strong> use the unsigned <code>.xap</code> file directly. Before you can install it on a device, you must first sign it with your company certificate, which you obtained from Symantec or Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote><p>For more information about how to sign Windows Phone mobile client applications, see the <a href="http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop">Microsoft Developer website</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>For Windows Store Apps for Windows 8 Pro</h3>
<ul>
<li>
        The <code><em>install_dir</em>/ApplicationCenter/installer/IBMApplicationCenterWindowsStore.zip</code> file contains the executable of the Application Center client. Distribute this file to the client computer and unzip it. It contains the executable program.
    </li>
<li>
        Installing a Windows Store app (a file of type <code>appx</code>) without using Microsoft Windows Store is called <em>sideloading</em> an app. To sideload an app, you must comply with the prerequisites in <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/dn613842.aspx">Prepare to Sideload Apps</a>. The Windows 8.1 update simplifies the prerequisites for sideloading. For more information, see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/micham/archive/2014/05/30/sideloading-store-apps-to-windows-8-1-devices.aspx">Sideloading Store Apps to Windows 8.1 Devices</a>.
