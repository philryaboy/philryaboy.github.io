<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Make sure to read the Adapters Overview tutorial first.</p>
<p>JavaScript adapters provide templates for connection to various back-ends, such as HTTP, SQL, Cast Iron, SAP JCo, and SAP Netweaver. JavaScript adapters also provide a service discovery wizard, which you can use to autogenerate adapters for connecting to WSDL services and more.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy of JavaScript adapters</h2>
<p>Each adapter consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>An XML file, which describes the connectivity options and lists the procedures that are exposed to the application or other adapters</li>
<li>A JavaScript file, which contains the implementation of procedures that are declared in the XML file</li>
<li>Zero, one, or more XSL files, which contain a transformation scheme for retrieved raw XML data</li>
</ul>
<p>Data that is retrieved by an adapter can be returned raw or preprocessed by the adapter itself. In either case, it is presented to the application as a <strong>JSON object</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="adapterProcedures">JavaScript adapter procedures</h2>
<p>Procedures are declared in XML and are implemented with server-side JavaScript, for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide adapter functions to the application</li>
<li>To call back-end services to retrieve data or to perform actions</li>
</ul>
<p>By using server-side JavaScript, a procedure can process the data before or after it calls the service.<br />
You can apply more filtering to retrieved data by using simple XSLT code.</p>
<p>JavaScript adapter procedures are implemented in JavaScript. However, because an adapter is a server-side entity, it is possible to use Java in the adapter code.</p>

<wl:adapter name="HelloWorld">

<ul>
<li><code>name:</code> Mandatory. The name of the adapter</li>
<li><code>displayName</code>: Optional. The name that is displayed in the MobileFirst Console</li>
<li><code>description</code>: Optional. Additional information that is displayed in the MobileFirst Console</li>
<li><code>connectivity</code>:
<ul>
<li>Defines the connection properties and load constraints of the back-end system.</li>
<li>When the back-end system requires user authentication, defines how user credentials are obtained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>procedure</code>: Declares a service for accessing a back-end application. One entry for each adapter procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>{% highlight xml  %}
<procedure name="procedure1"></procedure>
<procedure name="procedure2"></procedure>
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h2 id="procedureStructure">Structure of a JavaScript adapter procedure</h2>
<p>Each procedure that is declared in the adapter XML file must have a corresponding function in the JavaScript file.<br />
The <code>WL.Server</code> API defines a procedure logic in JavaScript.</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript  %}
function procedure1(param) {
  return WL.Server.invokeSQLStatement({
    preparedStatement: procedure1Statement,
    parameters: [param]
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h2 id="globalvars">Using global variables</h2>
<p>Depending on your infrastructure and configuration, your MobileFirst server may be running with <code>SessionIndependent</code> set to true, where each request may reach a different node and HTTP sessions are not used.<br />
In such cases you should not rely on global variables to keep data from one request to the next.</p>
