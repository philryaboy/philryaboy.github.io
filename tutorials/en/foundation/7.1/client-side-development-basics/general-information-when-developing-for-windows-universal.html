<h2 id="struct">Project structure</h2>
<p>A Windows 8 Universal app that is developed by using IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation comprises the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on WinJS</li>
<li>All application components, including the web code that the developer provides, packaged into a single Windows 8 Universal project, containing 3 projects: shared, Windows, Windows Phone</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>If you use a source control management system (such as Rational Team Concertâ„¢, Git, Subversion, and so on), see the topic about integrating with source control system, in the user documentation.

<h2 id="designW8">Designing for Windows Universal</h2>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>When you develop applications, it is useful to always consult the Microsoft <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/design">Develop</a> websites.</p>
<h2 id="envImages">Environment-specific images</h2>
<p>If you decide to implement the Application Bar feature in an app, you must put the various icons in the appropriate folder, in <code><em>your-project-name</em>\apps\<em>your-app-name</em>\windows8\Resources\applicationBar</code>.</p>
<p>The MobileFirst builder then copies these images to the native folder of the generated project.</p>
<p>The icons of the Application Bar must be 100x100 pixels and have a white foreground on a transparent background by using an alpha channel.<br />
The Application Bar colorizes the icon according to the current style settings. Using colored icons can result in an unpredictable display.<br />
Images that are not in the acceptable dimensions are scaled to fit, which can potentially lower the overall image quality of the Application Bar icon.<br />
The circle that is displayed on each icon button is drawn by the Application Bar. Do not include it in the source image.</p>
<h2 id="appOptim">Optimizing applications</h2>
<p>When developing a mobile application, you can use minification and concatenation to reduce the size and number of files that are used within the application. This feature is available for the following environments: Android, iOS, Windows 8 Universal, Windows Phone 8 Universal, BlackBerry 10, Mobile Web, and Desktop Browser.</p>
<blockquote><p>
For more information about minification and concatenation, see the topic about optimizing MobileFirst applications, in the user documentation.
</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="publish">Publishing</h2>
<p>To publish a Windows 8 Universal application, you must be a registered Windows Store Developer so that you can submit your applications to the Windows Phone Store.</p>
