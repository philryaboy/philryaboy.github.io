<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>JSONStore is an optional client-side API providing a lightweight, document-oriented storage system that is included as a feature of IBM MobileFirstâ„¢ Platform Foundation, and enables persistent storage of JSON documents. Documents in an application are available in JSONStore even when the device that is running the application is offline. This persistent, always-available storage can be useful to give them access to documents when, for example, there is no network connection to the device.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data indexing for efficient searching</li>
<li>Data encryption in production environments</li>
<li>Mechanism for tracking local-only changes to the stored data</li>
<li>Support for multiple users</li>
</ul>
