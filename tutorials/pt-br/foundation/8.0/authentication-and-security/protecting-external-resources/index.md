## Overview
{: #overview }
Protected resources can run on the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} (such as **Adapters**), or on **external servers**. You can protect resources on external servers by using the validation modules that are provided with {{ site.data.keys.product }}.

In this tutorial, you learn how to protect an external **resource server** by implementing a **filter** that validates a {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} **access token**.  
You can implement such protection either entirely with custom code, or by using one of the {{ site.data.keys.product }} helper libraries that encapsulate part of the flow.

* Understanding of the [{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} security framework](../).

## Flow
{: #flow }
![Protecting external resources diagram](external_resources_flow.jpg)

The {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} has a component called the **introspection endpoint** which is capable of validating and extracting data from a {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} **access token**. This introspection endpoint is available via a REST API.

1. An application with the {{ site.data.keys.product }} client SDK makes a resource request call (or any HTTP request) to a protected resource with or without the `Authorization` header (**client access token**).
2. To communicate with the introspection endpoint, the **filter** on the resource server needs to obtain a separate token for itself (see the **confidential client** section).
3. The **filter** on the resource server extracts the **client access token** from step 1, and sends it to the introspection endpoint for validation.
4. If the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Authorization Server determined that the token is invalid (or doesn't exist), the resource server redirects the client to obtain a new token for the required scope. This part happens internally when the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} lient SDK is used.

## Confidential Client
{: #confidential-client }
Because the introspection endpoint is an internal resource protected by the scope `authorization.introspect`, the resource server needs to obtain a separate token in order to send any data to it. If you attempt to make a request to the introspection endpoint without an authorization header, a 401 response is returned.

For the external resource server to be able to request a token for the `authorization.introspect` scope, the server needs to be registered as a **confidential client** via the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}.  

> Learn more in the [Confidential Clients](../confidential-clients/) tutorial.

In the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, under **Settings â†’ Confidential Clients**, add a new entry. Choose a **client Secret** and **API secret** value. Make sure to set `authorization.introspect` as the **Allowed Scope**.

## Implementations
{: #implementations }
This flow can be implemented manually by making HTTP requests directly to the various REST APIs (see documentation).  
{{ site.data.keys.product }} also provides libraries to help you achieve this on **WebSphere** servers by using the provided **Trust Association Interceptor**, or any other Java-based filter using the provided **Java Token Validator**:
