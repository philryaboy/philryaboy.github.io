{% comment %}
Do note use keywords in the keyword terms, as this presents issues with the glossary sort tool. (You can use keywords in the definitions.)
When the term should logically use a keyword, use the keyword text in the term, and add a no-translation comment.
For example, instead of using "{{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}" for the console term, use "MobileFirst Operations Console" and add the following between the term and the definition (starting with the "START NON-TRANSLATABLE" comment):
{% endcomment %}
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
{% comment %}
Do not translate "MobileFirst Operations Console" in the term above (site.data.keys.mf_console keyword).
{% endcomment %}
