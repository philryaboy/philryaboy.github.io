## Overview
{: #overview }
**Prerequisite:** Make sure to read the **CredentialsValidationSecurityCheck**'s [challenge handler implementation](../../credentials-validation/javascript) tutorial.

The challenge handler will demonstrate a few additional features (APIs) such as the preemptive `login`, `logout` and `obtainAccessToken`.

## Login
{: #login }
In this example, `UserLogin` expects *key:value*s called `username` and `password`. Optionally, it also accepts a Boolean `rememberMe` key, which tells the security check to remember this user for a longer period. In the sample application, this is collected by a Boolean value from a checkbox in the login form.

```js
userLoginChallengeHandler.submitChallengeAnswer({'username':username, 'password':password, rememberMe: rememberMeState});
```

You may also want to login a user without any challenge being received. For example, showing a login screen as the first screen of the application, or showing a login screen after a logout, or a login failure. We call those scenarios **preemptive logins**.

You cannot call the `submitChallengeAnswer` API if there is no challenge to answer. For those scenarios, the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK includes the `login` API:

```js
WLAuthorizationManager.login(securityCheckName,{'username':username, 'password':password, rememberMe: rememberMeState}).then(
    function () {
        WL.Logger.debug("login onSuccess");
    },
    function (response) {
        WL.Logger.debug("login onFailure: " + JSON.stringify(response));
    });
```

If the credentials are wrong, the security check sends back a **challenge**.

It is the developer's responsibility to know when to use `login`, as opposed to `submitChallengeAnswer`, based on the application's needs. One way to achieve this is to define a Boolean flag, for example `isChallenged`, and set it to `true` when `handleChallenge` is reached, or set it to `false` in any other cases (failure, success, initialization, etc).

When the user clicks the **Login** button, you can dynamically choose which API to use:

```js
if (isChallenged){
    userLoginChallengeHandler.submitChallengeAnswer({'username':username, 'password':password, rememberMe: rememberMeState});
} else {
    WLAuthorizationManager.login(securityCheckName,{'username':username, 'password':password, rememberMe: rememberMeState}).then(
//...
    );
}
```

> **Note:**
>The  `WLAuthorizationManager` `login()` API has its own `onSuccess` and `onFailure` methods, the `handleSuccess` or `handleFailure` methods of the relevant challenge handler are **also** called.

## Obtaining an access token
{: #obtaining-an-access-token }
Because this security check supports the **RememberMe** functionality (as the`rememberMe` Boolean key), it would be useful to check whether the client is currently logged in when the application starts.

The {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK provides the `obtainAccessToken` API to ask the server for a valid token:

```js
WLAuthorizationManager.obtainAccessToken(userLoginChallengeHandler.securityCheckName).then(
    function (accessToken) {
        WL.Logger.debug("obtainAccessToken onSuccess");
        showProtectedDiv();
    },
    function (response) {
        WL.Logger.debug("obtainAccessToken onFailure: " + JSON.stringify(response));
        showLoginDiv();
});
```
> **Note:**
> The `WLAuthorizationManager` `obtainAccessToken()` API has its own `onSuccess` and `onFailure` methods, the `handleSuccess` or `handleFailure` methods of the relevant challenge handler are **also** called.

If the client is already logged-in or is in the *remembered* state, the API triggers a success. If the client is not logged in, the security check sends back a challenge.

The `obtainAccessToken` API takes in a **scope**. The scope can be the name of your **security check**.

> Learn more about **scopes** in the [Authorization concepts](../../) tutorial.

## Retrieving the authenticated user
{: #retrieving-the-authenticated-user }
The challenge handler `handleSuccess` method receives `data` as a parameter.
If the security check sets an `AuthenticatedUser`, this object contains the user's properties. You can use `handleSuccess` to save the current user:

```js
userLoginChallengeHandler.handleSuccess = function(data) {
    WL.Logger.debug("handleSuccess");
    isChallenged = false;
    document.getElementById ("rememberMe").checked = false;
    document.getElementById('username').value = "";
    document.getElementById('password').value = "";
    document.getElementById("helloUser").innerHTML = "Hello, " + data.user.displayName;
    showProtectedDiv();
}
```

Here, `data` has a key called `user` which itself contains a `JSONObject` representing the `AuthenticatedUser`:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "john",
    "displayName": "john",
    "authenticatedAt": 1455803338008,
    "authenticatedBy": "UserLogin"
  }
}
```

## Logout
{: #logout }
The {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK also provides a `logout` API to log out from a specific security check:

```js
WLAuthorizationManager.logout(securityCheckName).then(
    function () {
        WL.Logger.debug("logout onSuccess");
        location.reload();
    },
    function (response) {
        WL.Logger.debug("logout onFailure: " + JSON.stringify(response));
    });
```

## Sample applications
{: #sample-applications }
Two samples are associated with this tutorial:

- **PreemptiveLogin**: An application that always starts with a login screen, using the preemptive `login` API.
- **RememberMe**: An application with a *Remember Me* checkbox. The user can bypass the login screen the next time the application is opened.

Both samples use the same `UserLogin` security check from the **SecurityCheckAdapters** adapter Maven project.

### Sample usage
{: #sample-usage }
Follow the sample's README.md file for instructions.
The username/password for the app must match, i.e. "john"/"john".
