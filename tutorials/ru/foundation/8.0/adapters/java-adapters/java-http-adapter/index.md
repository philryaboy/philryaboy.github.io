## Overview
{: #overview }

Java adapters provide free reign over connectivity to a backend system. It is therefore the developer's responsibility to ensure best practices regarding performance and other implementation details. This tutorial covers an example of a Java adapter that connects to an RSS feed by using a Java `HttpClient`.

**Prerequisite:** Make sure to read the [Java Adapters](../) tutorial first.

>**Important:** When you use static references to classes from `javax.ws.rs.*` or `javax.servlet.*`, within your adapter implementation, then you should ensure to configure the **RuntimeDelegate** using one of the options below:
*	Set  `-Djavax.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate=org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.impl.RuntimeDelegateImpl` in Liberty `jvm.options`
OR
*	Set the system property or JVM custom property `javax.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate=org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.impl.RuntimeDelegateImpl`

## Initializing the adapter
{: #initializing-the-adapter }

In the supplied sample adapter, the `JavaHTTPApplication` class is used to extend `MFPJAXRSApplication` and is a good place to trigger any initialization required by your application.

```java
@Override
protected void init() throws Exception {
    JavaHTTPResource.init();
    logger.info("Adapter initialized!");
}
```

## Implementing the adapter Resource class
{: #implementing-the-adapter-resource-class }

The adapter Resource class is where requests to the server are handled.  
In the supplied sample adapter, the class name is `JavaHTTPResource`.

```java
@Path("/")
public class JavaHTTPResource {

}
```

`@Path("/")` means that the resources will be available at the URL `http(s)://host:port/ProjectName/adapters/AdapterName/`.

### HTTP Client
{: #http-client }

```java
private static CloseableHttpClient client;
private static HttpHost host;

public static void init() {
  client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();
  host = new HttpHost("mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com");
}
```

Because every request to your resource will create a new instance of `JavaHTTPResource`, it is important to reuse objects that may impact performance. In this example we made the Http client a `static` object and initialized it in a static `init()` method, which gets called by the `init()` of `JavaHTTPApplication` as described above.

### Procedure resource
{: #procedure-resource }

```java
@GET
@Produces("application/json")
public void get(@Context HttpServletResponse response, @QueryParam("tag") String tag)
    throws IOException, IllegalStateException, SAXException {
  if(tag!=null && !tag.isEmpty()){
    execute(new HttpGet("/blog/atom/"+ tag +".xml"), response);
  }
  else{
    execute(new HttpGet("/feed.xml"), response);
  }

}
```

The sample adapter exposes just one resource URL which allows to retrieve the RSS feed from the backend service.

* `@GET` means that this procedure only responds to `HTTP GET` requests.
* `@Produces("application/json")` specifies the Content Type of the response to send back. We chose to send the response as a `JSON` object to make it easier on the client-side.
* `@Context HttpServletResponse response` will be used to write to the response output stream. This enables us more granularity than returning a simple string.
* `@QueryParam("tag")` String tag enables the procedure to receive a parameter. The choice of `QueryParam` means the parameter is to be passed in the query (`/JavaHTTP/?tag=MobileFirst_Platform`). Other options include `@PathParam`, `@HeaderParam`, `@CookieParam`, `@FormParam`, etc.
* `throws IOException, ...` means we are forwarding any exception back to the client. The client code is responsible for handling potential exceptions which will be received as `HTTP 500` errors. Another solution (more likely in production code) is to handle exceptions in your server Java code and decide what to send to the client based on the exact error.
* `execute(new HttpGet("/feed.xml"), response)`. The actual HTTP request to the backend service is handled by another method defined later.

Depending if you pass a `tag` parameter, `execute` will retrieve a different build a different path and retrieve a different RSS file.

### execute()
{: #execute }

```java
public void execute(HttpUriRequest req, HttpServletResponse resultResponse)
        throws IOException,
        IllegalStateException, SAXException {
    HttpResponse RSSResponse = client.execute(host, req);
    ServletOutputStream os = resultResponse.getOutputStream();
    if (RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.SC_OK){  
        resultResponse.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        String json = XML.toJson(RSSResponse.getEntity().getContent());
        os.write(json.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF-8")));

    }else{
        resultResponse.setStatus(RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
        RSSResponse.getEntity().getContent().close();
        os.write(RSSResponse.getStatusLine().getReasonPhrase().getBytes());
    }
    os.flush();
    os.close();
}
```

* `HttpResponse RSSResponse = client.execute(host, req)`. We use our static HTTP client to execute the HTTP request and store the response.
* `ServletOutputStream os = resultResponse.getOutputStream()`. This is the output stream to write a response to the client.
* `resultResponse.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")`. As mentioned before, we chose to send the response as JSON.
* `String json = XML.toJson(RSSResponse.getEntity().getContent())`. We used `org.apache.wink.json4j.utils.XML` to convert the XML RSS to a JSON string.
* `os.write(json.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF-8")))` the resulting JSON string is written to the output stream.

The output stream is then `flush`ed and `close`d.

If `RSSResponse` is not `200 OK`, we write the status code and reason in the response instead.

## Sample adapter
{: #sample-adapter }

[Click to download](https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/Adapters/tree/release80) the Adapters Maven project.

The Adapters Maven project includes the **JavaHTTP** adapter described above.

### Sample usage
{: #sample-usage }

* Use either Maven, {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }} or your IDE of choice to [build and deploy the JavaHTTP adapter](../../creating-adapters/).
* To test or debug an adapter, see the [testing and debugging adapters](../../testing-and-debugging-adapters) tutorial.
