## Overview
{: #overview }

As taught in previous [Adapters tutorials](../), adapters are Maven projects that are created by using either Maven directly or via the {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }}. The adapter code can then be edited in any IDE, and later built and deployed using either Maven or the {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }}. A developer may also choose to create, develop, build and deploy all inside a supported IDEs, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. In this tutorial an adapter is created and built from the Eclipse IDE.

> For instructions how to use IntelliJ see the [Using IntelliJ to Develop MobileFirst Java Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/31/using-intellij-to-develop-adapters) Blog Post.

**Prerequisite:**

* Get familiarized with adapters by reading the [Adapters tutorials](../) first.
* Maven integration in Eclipse. Starting Eclipse Kepler (v4.3), Maven support is built-in in Eclipse. If your Eclipse instance does not support Maven, [follow the m2e instructions](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) to add Maven support.

## Create or import an Adapter Maven project
{: #create-or-import-an-adapter-maven-project }

Follow the bellow instructions to either create a new adapter Maven project or import an existing one.

### Creating a new adapter Maven project
{: #creating-a-new-adapter-maven-project }

1. To create a new adapter Maven project, select: **File → New → Other... → Maven → Maven Project** and click **Next**.

2. Provide project name and location.  
    - Make sure the option to create a simple project is ticked **off** and click **Next**.

3. Select or add the adapter Archetype.
    - If you [installed the archetypes locally](../creating-adapters/#install-maven) and they are not appearing in the list of archetypes, select **Configure → Add Local Catalog → Browse to the /.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml in the home directory**.
    - Click on **Add Archetype** and provide the following details:
        - **Archetype Group Id**: `com.ibm.mfp`
        - **Archetype Artifact Id**: either `adapter-maven-archetype-java`, `adapter-maven-archetype-http` or `adapter-maven-archetype-sql`
        - **Archetype Version**: you can find the latest available version in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccom.ibm.mfp)

4. Specify Maven project parameters.  
    - Specify required **Group Id**, **Artifact Id**, **Version** and **package** parameters, and click **Finish**.

### Importing an existing adapter Maven project
{: #importing-an-existing-adapter-maven-project }

To import the adapter Maven project, select **File → Import... → Maven → Existing Maven Projects**.

## Building and deploying an adapter Maven project
{: #building-and-deploying-an-adapter-maven-project }

An adapter project can be built and deployed by using either Maven command-line commands, the {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }} or from Eclipse.  
[Learn how to build and deploy adapters](../creating-adapters/#build-and-deploy-adapters).

> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> **Tip:** Eclipse can also be enhanced to ease the deployment step by integrating a **Command-line** window using a plug-in, creating a consistant development environment. From this window Maven or {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }} commands can be run.

### Building an adapter
{: #building-an-adapter }

To build an adapter, right-click on the adapter folder and select **Run As → Maven install**.  

### Deploying an adapter
{: #deploying-an-adapter }

To deploy an adapter, first add the deploy Maven command:

1. Select **Run → Run Configurations...**, right-click on **Maven Build** and select **New**.
2. Provide a Name: "Maven deploy".
2. Set as a Goal: "adapter:deploy".
3. Click **Apply** followed by clicking on **Run** to have an initial deploy.

You can now right-click on the adapter folder and select **Run As → Maven Deploy**

### Building and deploying an adapter
{: #building-and-deploying-an-adapter }

You can also combine the "build" and  "deploy" Maven Goals to a single "build and deploy" Goal: "clean install adapter:deploy".
