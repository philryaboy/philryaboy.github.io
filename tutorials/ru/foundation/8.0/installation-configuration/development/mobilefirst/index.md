## Overview
{: #overview }
{{ site.data.keys.product_full }} is made up of several components: the client SDKs, adapter archetypes, security checks, and authentication tools.

These components are available from online repositories and can be installed using package managers. These online repositories provide the latest release of each component. The same component is also available to download from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit }} for local use. Note that the version that is available from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_short }} represents the version that was available at the time the specific {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_short }} build was released, and that downloading a new {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_short }} build will be required in order to use the latest.

> To evalute {{ site.data.keys.product }} all that is needed is to spin an instance of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on IBM Cloud using the Mobile Foundation IBM Cloud service. See the [Using Mobile Foundation](../../../bluemix/using-mobile-foundation/) tutorial for instructions. You may also choose to install the {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_short }} for a local installation.

The kit consists of the following components: {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} &amp; {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, MobileFirst Developer Command-line Interface (CLI), as well as optionally provides client SDKs and adapter tooling for download.

> **Note:** If you need to set up your development environment on a computer that has no internet access, you can install components offline. See [How to set up an offline IBM MobileFirst development environment]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/03/31/howto-set-up-an-offline-ibm-mobilefirst-8-0-development-environment).

### {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_short }} Installer
