{: #overview }
The {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} public REST API is documented in Swagger.  
To view and interact with Swagger, deploy the **analytics-service.war** (in the devcenter it is pre-deployed) file and go to the following url using your browser: `http://hostname:port/analytics-service`.

> **Note:** Replace the _**hostname**_ and _**port**_ with your server hostname and port values.
