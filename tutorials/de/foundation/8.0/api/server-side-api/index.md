{{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} provides a set of mobile capabilities with the use of client/server integration and communication between mobile applications and back-end systems.

## Adapter library
{: #adapter-library }
You can use the adapter library to connect to various back-end systems, such as web services, databases, and messaging applications. For example, {{ site.data.keys.product_full }} provides Java and JavaScript adapters for HTTP, SQL and JX-RS-based Java adapters. For more information about developing adapters, see [Developing Adapters](../../adapters).

## Security libraries

You can use the security libraries to develop security checks and adapters that use the security context. The libraries provide the required interfaces for adapters and security checks to gain access to the security context.
