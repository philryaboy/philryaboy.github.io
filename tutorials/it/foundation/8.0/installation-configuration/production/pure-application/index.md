### Key benefits
{: #key-benefits }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} provides the following benefits:

* Predefined templates enable you to build patterns in a simple way for the most typical {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} deployment topologies. Examples of the topologies are  
    * IBM WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile single node
    * IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile multiple nodes
    * IBM WebSphere Application Server full profile single node
    * IBM WebSphere Application Server full profile multiple nodes
    * Clusters of WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment servers
    * {{ site.data.keys.mf_app_center }} deployment topologies such as
        * IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile single node
        * IBM WebSphere Application Server full profile single node
* Script packages act as building blocks to compose extended deployment topologies such as automating the inclusion of an analytics server in a pattern and flexible DB VM deployment options. WebSphere Application Server and DB2 script packages are available through the inclusion of WebSphere Application Server and DB2 pattern types.
* Optional JNDI properties in the runtime deployment script package allow fine-grained tuning for the deployment topology. In addition, deployment topologies that are built with IBM WebSphere Application Server full profile now support accessing the WebSphere Application Server Administration Console, which gives you full control over the configuration of the application server.

### Important restrictions
{: #important-restrictions }
Depending on the pattern template you use, do not change some of the component attributes. If you change any of these component attributes, the deployment of patterns that are based on these templates fails.

If you change any of these attributes, your pattern deployment fails.

### Limitations
{: #limitations }
The following limitations apply:

* Dynamic scaling for WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server farms and WebSphere Application Server full profile server farms is not supported. The number of server farm nodes can be specified in the pattern by setting the scaling policy but cannot be changed during run time.
* The {{ site.data.keys.v63_to_80prerebrand_product_full }} System Pattern Extension for {{ site.data.keys.mf_studio }} and Ant command-line interface that are supported in versions earlier than V7.0, are not available for the current version of {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}.
* {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} depends on WebSphere Application Server Patterns, which has its own restrictions. For more information, see [Restrictions for WebSphere Application Server Patterns](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSAJ7T_1.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.waspatt20base.doc/ae/rins_patternsB_restrictions.html).
* Due to restrictions in the uninstallation of Virtual System Patterns, you must delete the script packages manually after you delete the pattern type. In IBM PureApplication System, go to **Catalog → Script Packages** to delete the script packages that are listed in the **Components** section.
* The MobileFirst (WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment) pattern template does not support token licensing. If you want to use this pattern, you must use perpetual licensing. All other patterns support token licensing.

### Composition
{: #composition }
{{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} is composed of the following patterns:

* IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Patterns 2.2.0.0.
* [PureApplication Service] WebSphere 8558 for Mobile IM repository to allow the WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Patterns to work. Contact the administrator for IBM PureApplication System to confirm that the WebSphere 8558 IM repository is installed.
* IBM DB2 with BLU Acceleration  Pattern 1.2.4.0.
* {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}.

### Components
{: #components }
In addition to all components provided by IBM WebSphere Application Server Pattern and IBM DB2 with BLU Acceleration Pattern, {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} provides the following Script Packages:

* MFP Administration DB
* MFP Runtime DB
* MFP Server Prerequisite
* MFP Server Administration
* MFP Server Runtime Deployment
* MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment
* MFP IHS Configuration
* MFP Analytics
* MFP Open Firewall Ports for WAS
* MFP WAS SDK Level
* MFP Server Application Center

### Compatibility between pattern types and artifacts created with different product versions
{: #compatibility-between-pattern-types-and-artifacts-created-with-different-product-versions }
If you use MobileFirst Studio V6.3.0 or earlier to develop your applications, you can upload the associated runtime, application, and adapter artifacts into patterns associated with {{ site.data.keys.v63_to_80prerebrand_product_full }} V7.0.0 and later.

Pattern types that are associated with {{ site.data.keys.v63_to_80prerebrand_product_full }} V6.3.0 or earlier are not compatible with runtime, application, and adapter artifacts created by using MobileFirst Studio V7.0.0 and later.

For versions V6.0.0 and earlier, only the same versions of server, **.war** file, application (**.wlapp** file), and adapters are compatible.

## Installing {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}
{: #installing-mobilefirst-system-pattern }
You can find the **{{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern_file }}** file. Make sure you extract the file before you start this procedure.

1. Log in to IBM  PureApplication System with an account that has permission to create new pattern types.
2. Go to **Catalog → Pattern Types**.
3. Upload the {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} **.tgz** file:
    * On the toolbar, click **+**. The "Install a pattern type" window opens.
    * In the Local tab, click **Browse**, select the {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }} **.tgz** file, and then wait for the upload process to complete. The pattern type is displayed in the list and is marked as not enabled.
4. In the list of pattern types, click the uploaded pattern type. Details of the pattern type are displayed.
5. In the License Agreement row, click **License**. The License window is displayed stating the terms of the license agreement.
6. To accept the license, click **Accept**. Details of the pattern type now show that the license is accepted.
7. In the Status row, click **Enable**. The pattern type is now listed as being enabled.
8. Mandatory for PureApplication Service: After the pattern type is enabled successfully, go to **Catalog → Script** Packages and select script packages with names similar to "MFP \*\*\*". On the details page to the right, accept the license in the **License agreement** field. Repeat for all eleven script packages listed in the Components section.

## Token licensing requirements for {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}
{: #token-licensing-requirements-for-mobilefirst-system-pattern }
If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, you must install IBM  Rational  License Key Server and configure with your licenses before you deploy the {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern_full }}.

> **Important:** The {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) pattern template does not support token licensing. You must be using perpetual licensing when you deploy patterns based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) pattern template. All other pattern templates support token licensing.

Your IBM Rational License Key Server must be external to your PureApplication  System. {{ site.data.keys.system_pattern }} does not support the PureApplication System shared service for IBM Rational License Key Server.

In addition, you must know the following information about your Rational License Key Server to add the license key server information to your pattern attributes:

* Fully qualified host name or IP address of your Rational License Key Server
* License manager daemon (**lmgrd**) port
* Vendor daemon (**ibmratl**) port

If you have a firewall between your Rational License Key Server and your PureApplication System, ensure that both daemon ports are open in your firewall.
The deployment of {{ site.data.keys.system_pattern }} fails if the license key server cannot be contacted or if insufficient license tokens are available.

For details about installing and configuring Rational License Key Server, see [IBM Support - Rational licensing start page](http://www.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/).

## Deploying {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on a single-node WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server
{: #deploying-mobilefirst-server-on-a-single-node-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-server }
You use a predefined template to deploy {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on a single-node WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile server.

This procedure involves uploading certain artifacts to IBM  PureApplication  System such as the required application and adapter. Before you begin, ensure that the artifacts are available for upload.

**Token licensing requirements:** If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, review the requirements outlined in [Token licensing requirements for {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}](#token-licensing-requirements-for-mobilefirst-system-pattern) before you continue. The deployment of this pattern fails if the license key server cannot be contacted or if insufficient license tokens are available.

Some parameters of script packages in the template have been configured with the recommended values and are not mentioned in this section. For fine-tuning purposes, see more information about all the parameters of script packages in [Script packages for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](#script-packages-for-mobilefirst-server).

For more information about the composition and configuration options of the predefined template that is used in this procedure, see [{{ site.data.keys.product }} (Liberty single node) template](#mobilefirst-foundation-liberty-single-node-template).

1. Create a pattern from the predefined template:
    * In the IBM PureApplication System dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Patterns**. The Virtual System Patterns page opens.
    * On the **Virtual System Patterns** page, click **Create New**, and then in the pop-up window, select **MobileFirst Platform (Liberty single node)** from the list of predefined templates. If the name is only partially visible due to its length, you can confirm that the correct template is selected by viewing its description on the **More information** tab.
    * In the **Name** field, provide a name for the pattern.
    * In the **Version** field, specify the version number of the pattern.
    * Click **Start Building**.
2. Mandatory for AIX : In IBM PureApplication System running on Power , the MobileFirst Platform DB node needs to use the AIX-specific add-on component "Default AIX add disk" to replace the "Default add disk" component in the template to support the jfs2 file system:
    * In the Pattern Builder, select the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node.
    * Click the **Add a Component Add-on** button (the button is visible above the component box when you hover the cursor over the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node).
    * From the **Add Add-ons** list, select **Default AIX add disk**. The component is added as the lowest component of the MobileFirst Platform DB node.
    * Select the **Default AIX add disk** component and specify the following attributes:
        * **DISK_SIZE_GB:** Storage size (measured in GB) to be extended to the DB server. Example value: **10**.
        * **FILESYSTEM_TYPE:** Supported file system in AIX. Default value: **jfs2**.
        * **MOUNT_POINT:** Align with the attribute **Mount point for instance owner** in the Database Server component in the MobileFirst Platform DB node. Example value: **/dbinst**.
        * **VOLUME_GROUP:** Example value: **group1**. Contact your IBM PureApplication System administrator for the correct value.
    * In the MobileFirst Platform DB node, select the **Default add disk** component, and then click the bin icon to delete it.
    * Save the pattern.
3. Optional: Configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration. You can skip this step if you want to specify the user credential with {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration privilege later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 9. To specify it now, complete these steps:

    > **Note:** If you want to configure administration security with an LDAP server, you need to supply additional LDAP information. For more information, see [Configuring {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration security with an external LDAP repository](#configuring-mobilefirst-administration-security-with-an-external-ldap-repository).
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Administration** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Next to the **admin_user** and **admin_password** fields, click the Delete button to clear their pattern level parameter settings.
    * In the **admin_user** and **admin\_password** fields, specify the administration user name and password.
    * If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, complete the following fields. If you do not use token licensing, leave these fields blank.

    **ACTIVATE\_TOKEN\_LICENSE**: Select this field to license your pattern with token licensing.  
    **LICENSE\_SERVER\_HOSTNAME**: Enter the fully qualified host name or IP address of your Rational License Key Server.  
    **LMGRD\_PORT**: Enter the port number that the license manager daemon (**lmrgd**) listens for connections on. The default license manager daemon port is 27000.  
    **IBMRATL\_PORT**:Enter the port number that the vendor daemon (**ibmratl**) listens for connections on. The default vendor daemon port is typically 27001.  

    A default administration account for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is created during pattern deployment.

4. Optional: Configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} runtime deployment. You can skip this step if you want to specify the context root name for the runtime later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 9. To specify the context root name now, complete these steps:
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Runtime Deployment** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Next to the **runtime\_contextRoot** field, click the **Delete** button to clear the pattern level parameter setting.
    * In the **runtime\_contextRoot** field, specify the runtime context root name. Note that the context root name must start with a forward slash, /; for example, `/HelloWorld`.

5. Upload application and adapter artifacts:

    > **Important:** When specifying the Target path for applications and adapters, make sure all the applications and adapters are placed in the same directory. For example, if one target path is **/opt/tmp/deploy/HelloWorld-common.json**, all the other target paths should be `/opt/tmp/deploy/*`.
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Application** or **MFP Server Adapter** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * In the **Additional file** field, click the **Browse** button to locate and upload the application or adapter artifact.
    * In the **Target path** field, specify the full path for storing the artifact including its file name; for example, **/opt/tmp/deploy/HelloWorld-common.json**.
    * If no application or adapter is to be deployed in the pattern, remove the relevant component by clicking the **X** button inside it. To get an empty {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} deployed without any app or adapter installed, remove the MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment component by clicking the X button inside it.

6. Optional: Add more application or adapter artifacts for deployment:
    * From the **Assets** toolbar, expand **Software Components**, and then drag and drop an **Additional file** component onto the MobileFirst Platform Server node in the canvas. Rename it to **{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} App\_X** or **{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Adatper\_X** (where **X** stands for a unique number for differentiation).
    * Hover the cursor over the newly added App or Adapter component, and then click the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to adjust its sequence in the node. Make sure it is placed after the MFP Runtime Deployment component but before the MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment component.
    * Click the newly added application or adapter component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas. Upload the application or adapter artifact and specify its target path by referring to the steps in step 6.
    * Repeat step 7 to add more applications and adapters for deployment.

7. Optional: Configure application and adapter deployment to {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}. You can skip this step if you want to specify the user credential with deployment privilege later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 9. If you have specified the default admin user credential in step 3, you can now specify the deployer user, which must align with the admin user credential:
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, select the **MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Find the parameters named **deployer_user** and **deployer_password**, and then click the adjacent Delete buttons to clear the pattern level parameter settings.
    * In the **deployer\_user** and **deployer\_password** fields, specify the user name and password.

8. Configure and launch the pattern deployment:
    * In the IBM PureApplication System dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Patterns**.
    * On the **Virtual System Patterns** page, use the **Search** field to find the pattern you created, and then select the pattern.
    * In the toolbar above the panel displaying detailed information about the pattern, click the Deploy button.
    * In the Deploy Pattern window, in the Configure panel, select the correct environment profile from the **Environment Profile** list, and provide other IBM PureApplication System environment parameters. To obtain the correct information, consult your IBM PureApplication System administrator.
    * In the middle column, click **Pattern attributes** to display attributes such as user names and passwords.

        Supply the following information in the fields provided:

        > **Note:** Make appropriate changes to the default values of the pattern-level parameters even if an external LDAP server is configured. If you configure administration security by using an LDAP server, you need to supply additional LDAP information. For more information, see [Configuring {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration security with an external LDAP repository](#configuring-mobilefirst-administration-security-with-an-external-ldap-repository).
        
        **admin\_user**  
        Not visible if configured in step 3. Create a default {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administrator account. Default value: demo.
        
        **admin\_password**  
        Not visible if configured in step 3. Default admin account password. Default value: demo.
        
        **ACTIVATE\_TOKEN\_LICENSE**  
        Not visible if configured in step 3. Select this field to license your pattern with token licensing. Leave this field clear if you use perpetual licenses.
        
        **LICENSE\_SERVER\_HOSTNAME**  
        Not visible if configured in step 3. If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, enter the fully-qualified hostname or IP address of your Rational License Key Server IP address. Otherwise, leave this field blank.
        
        **LMGRD\_PORT**   
        Not visible if configured in step 3. If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, enter the port number that the license manager daemon (lmrgd) listens for connections on. Otherwise, leave this field blank.
        The default license manager daemon port is 27000.

        **IBMRATL\_PORT**  
        Not visible if configured in step 3. If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, enter the port number that the vendor daemon (ibmratl) listens for connections on. Otherwise, leave this field blank.
        The default vendor daemon port is typically 27001.

        **runtime\_contextRoot**  
        Not visible if configured in step 5. Context root name for the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} runtime. The name must start with "/".
        
        **deployer\_user**  
        Not visible if configured in step 8. User name for the account with deployment privilege. If an external LDAP server is not configured, you must enter the same value as was specified when creating the default admin user for the administration service, because in this case, the only authorized user for app and adapter deployment is the default admin user.
        
        **deployer\_password**  
        Not visible if configured in step 8. User password for the user with deployment privilege.
        
        **MFP Vms Password(root)**

        **MFP DB Password(Instance owner)**  
        Instance owner password for the MobileFirst Platform DB node. Default value: **passw0rd**.    
    * Click **Quick Deploy** to launch your pattern deployment. After a few seconds, a message is displayed to indicate that the pattern has started to launch. You can click the URL provided in the message to track your pattern deployment status or go to **Patterns → Virtual System Instances** to open the Virtual System Instances page and search for your pattern there.

    If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, your pattern will fail to deploy if insufficient license tokens are available or if the license key server IP address and port were entered incorrectly.

9. Access the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}:
    * Click **Patterns → Virtual System Instances** to open the Virtual System Instances page and search for your pattern there. Make sure it is in Running state.
    * Select the pattern name and expand the **Virtual machine perspective** option in the panel displaying details of the selected instance.
    * Find the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} VM that has a name similar to **MobileFirst\_Platform\_Server.** and make a note of its Public IP address: you need this information in the following step.
    * In the browser, open the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} by composing its URL with one of the following formats:
        * `http://{MFP Server VM Public IP}:9080/mfpconsole`
        * `https://{MFP Server VM Public IP}:9443/mfpconsole`
    * Log in to the Console with admin user and password specified in step 3 or step 9.

## Deploying {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on a multiple-node WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server
{: #deploying-mobilefirst-server-on-a-multiple-node-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-server }
You use a predefined template to deploy {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on a multiple-node WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile server.

This procedure involves uploading certain artifacts to IBM  PureApplication  System such as the required application and adapter. Before you begin, ensure that the artifacts are available for upload.

**Token licensing requirements:** If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, review the requirements outlined in [Token licensing requirements for {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}](#token-licensing-requirements-for-mobilefirst-system-pattern) before you continue. The deployment of this pattern fails if the license key server cannot be contacted or if insufficient license tokens are available.

Some parameters of script packages in the template have been configured with the recommended values and are not mentioned in this section. For fine-tuning purposes, see more information about all the parameters of script packages in [Script packages for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](#script-packages-for-mobilefirst-server).

For more information about the composition and configuration options of the predefined template that is used in this procedure, see [{{ site.data.keys.product }} (Liberty server farm) template](#mobilefirst-foundation-liberty-server-farm-template).

1. Create a pattern from the predefined template:
    * In the IBM PureApplication System dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Patterns**. The **Virtual System Patterns** page opens.
    * On the **Virtual System Patterns** page, click **Create New**, and then in the pop-up window, select **MobileFirst Platform (Liberty server farm)** from the list of predefined templates. If the name is only partially visible due to its length, you can confirm that the correct template is selected by viewing its description on the **More information** tab.
    * In the **Name** field, provide a name for the pattern.
    * In the **Version** field, specify the version number of the pattern.
    * Click **Start Building**.
2. Mandatory for AIX : In IBM PureApplication System running on Power , the MobileFirst Platform DB node needs to use the AIX-specific add-on component "Default AIX add disk" to replace the "Default add disk" component in the template to support the **jfs2** file system:
    * In the Pattern Builder, select the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node.
    * Click the **Add a Component Add-on** button (the button is visible above the component box when you hover the cursor over the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node).
    * From the **Add Add-ons** list, select **Default AIX add disk**. The component is added as the lowest component of the MobileFirst Platform DB node.
    * Select the **Default AIX add disk** component and specify the following attributes:

## Deploying {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on clusters of WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment servers
{: #deploying-mobilefirst-server-on-clusters-of-websphere-application-server-network-deployment-servers }
You can use a predefined template to deploy {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on clusters of WebSphere  Application Server Network Deployment servers. This {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern_short }} template does not support token licensing.

This procedure involves uploading certain artifacts to IBM  PureApplication  System such as the required application and adapter. Before you begin, ensure that the artifacts are available for upload.

If you are running the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service, the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime environment might fail to start correctly when you deploy the pattern. If possible, stop the shared service before you continue with this procedure. If you cannot stop the shared service, you might need to restart the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console to fix the problem. For more information, see [{{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime synchronization limitation with WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment](#mobilefirst-foundation-runtime-synchronization-limitation-with-websphere-application-server-network-deployment). 

**Important token licensing restriction:** This pattern template does not support token licensing. You must be using perpetual licensing when you deploy patterns based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) pattern template.

Some parameters of script packages in the template are configured with recommended values and are not covered in this topic. For fine-tuning purposes, see more information about all the parameters of script packages in [Script packages for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](#script-packages-for-mobilefirst-server).

For more information about the composition and configuration options of the predefined template that is used in this procedure, see [{{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) template](#mobilefirst-foundation-was-nd-template).

1. Create a pattern from the predefined template:
    * In the IBM PureApplication System dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Patterns**. The Virtual System Patterns page opens.
    * On the **Virtual System Patterns** page, click **Create New**, and then in the pop-up window, select **MobileFirst Platform (WAS ND)** from the list of predefined templates. If the name is only partially visible due to its length, you can confirm that the correct template is selected by viewing its description on the **More information** tab.
    * In the **Name** field, provide a name for the pattern.
    * In the **Version** field, specify the version number of the pattern.
    * Click **Start Building**.
2. Mandatory for AIX : In IBM PureApplication System running on Power , the MobileFirst Platform DB node needs to use the AIX-specific add-on component "Default AIX add disk" to replace the "Default add disk" component in the template to support the jfs2 file system:
    * In the Pattern Builder, select the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node.
    * Click the **Add a Component Add-on** button (the button is visible above the component box when you hover the cursor over the **MobileFirst Platform DB** node).
    * From the **Add Add-ons** list, select **Default AIX add disk**. The component is added as the lowest component of the MobileFirst Platform DB node.
    * Select the **Default AIX add disk** component and specify the following attributes:
        * **DISK_SIZE_GB:** Storage size (measured in GB) to be extended to the DB server. Example value: **10**.
        * **FILESYSTEM_TYPE:** Supported file system in AIX. Default value: **jfs2**.
        * **MOUNT_POINT:** Align with the attribute **Mount point for instance owner** in the Database Server component in the MobileFirst Platform DB node. Example value: **/dbinst**.
        * **VOLUME_GROUP:** Example value: **group1**. Contact your IBM PureApplication System administrator for the correct value.
    * In the MobileFirst Platform DB node, select the **Default add disk** component, and then click the bin icon to delete it.
    * Save the pattern.
3. Optional: Configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration. You can skip this step if you want to specify the user credential with {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administration privilege later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 9. To specify it now, complete these steps:

    > **Note:** If you want to configure administration security with an LDAP server, you need to supply additional LDAP information. For more information, see [Configuring {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration security with an external LDAP repository](#configuring-mobilefirst-administration-security-with-an-external-ldap-repository).
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Administration** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Next to the **admin_user** and **admin_password** fields, click the Delete button to clear their pattern level parameter settings.
    * In the **admin_user** and **admin\_password** fields, specify the administration user name and password.
    * If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, complete the following fields. If you do not use token licensing, leave these fields blank.

    **ACTIVATE\_TOKEN\_LICENSE**: Select this field to license your pattern with token licensing.  
    **LICENSE\_SERVER\_HOSTNAME**: Enter the fully qualified host name or IP address of your Rational License Key Server.  
    **LMGRD\_PORT**: Enter the port number that the license manager daemon (**lmrgd**) listens for connections on. The default license manager daemon port is 27000.  
    **IBMRATL\_PORT**:Enter the port number that the vendor daemon (**ibmratl**) listens for connections on. The default vendor daemon port is typically 27001.  

    A default administration account for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is created during pattern deployment.

4. Optional: Configure {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} runtime deployment. You can skip this step if you want to specify the context root name for the runtime later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 10. To specify the context root name now, complete these steps:
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Runtime Deployment** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Next to the **runtime\_contextRoot** field, click the **Delete** button to clear the pattern level parameter setting.
    * In the **runtime\_contextRoot** field, specify the runtime context root name. Note that the context root name must start with a forward slash, /; for example, `/HelloWorld`.

5. Optional: Adjust the number of application server nodes in your WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment clusters for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration component and the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime environment.

    By default, the Administration component and runtime environment each have two application server nodes in their respective clusters.
    * In the DmgrNode node, click the **MFP Server Administration** component. The properties of the component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * In the **NUMBER\_OF\_CLUSTERMEMBERS** field, specify the number of application server nodes that you want in your WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cluster for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration component.
    * In the DmgrNode node, click the **MFP Server Runtime Deployment** component. The properties of the component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * In the **NUMBER\_OF\_CLUSTERMEMBERS** field, specify the number of application server nodes that you want in your WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cluster for the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime environment.
    * In the CustomNode node, click the **Base Scaling Policy** component.
    * Adjust the **Number of Instances** value to account for the total number of application server nodes that you entered in the **NUMBER\_OF\_CLUSTERMEMBERS** field for each component.
    The minimum value for **Number of Instances** is the total number of server nodes for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration component and the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime environments.

    For example, the default value for **Number of Instances** is 4 for the default topology with two nodes for the administration component and two nodes for the runtime environment. If you change **NUMBER\_OF\_CLUSTERMEMBERS** values for the administration component to 3 and for the runtime environment to 5, the minimum value for Number of Instances is 8.

6. Upload application and adapter artifacts:

    > **Important:** When specifying the Target path for applications and adapters, make sure all the applications and adapters are placed in the same directory. For example, if one target path is **/opt/tmp/deploy/HelloWorld-common.json**, all the other target paths should be `/opt/tmp/deploy/*`.
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, click the **MFP Server Application** or **MFP Server Adapter** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * In the **Additional file** field, click the **Browse** button to locate and upload the application or adapter artifact.
    * In the **Target path** field, specify the full path for storing the artifact including its file name; for example, **/opt/tmp/deploy/HelloWorld-common.json**.
    * If no application or adapter is to be deployed in the pattern, remove the relevant component by clicking the **X** button inside it. To get an empty {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} deployed without any app or adapter installed, remove the MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment component by clicking the X button inside it.

7. Optional: Add more application or adapter artifacts for deployment:
    * From the **Components** toolbar, expand **Software Components**, and then drag and drop an **Additional file** component onto the MobileFirst Platform Server node in the canvas. Rename it **{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} App\_X** or **{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Adatper\_X** (where **X** stands for a unique number for differentiation).
    * Hover the cursor over the newly added App or Adapter component, and then click the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to adjust its sequence in the node. Make sure it is placed after the MFP Runtime Deployment component but before the MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment component.
    * Click the newly added application or adapter component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas. Upload the application or adapter artifact and specify its target path by referring to the steps in step 6.
    * In the **Additional file** field, click the **Browse** button to locate and upload the application or adapter artifact.
    * In the **Target path** field, specify the full path for storing the artifact, including its file name. For example, **/opt/tmp/deploy/HelloWorld-common.wlapp**.

    Repeat this step if you want to add more applications and adapters for deployment.

8. Optional: Configure application and adapter deployment to {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}. You can skip this step if you want to specify the user credential with deployment privilege later during the pattern deployment configuration phase in step 10. If you have specified the default admin user credential in step 3, you can now specify the deployer user, which must align with the admin user credential:
    * In the MobileFirst Platform Server node, select the **MFP Server Application Adapter Deployment** component. The properties of the selected component are displayed next to the canvas.
    * Find the parameters named **deployer_user** and **deployer_password**, and then click the adjacent Delete buttons to clear the pattern level parameter settings.
    * In the **deployer\_user** and **deployer\_password** fields, specify the user name and password.

9. Configure base scaling policy:
    * In the IBM PureApplication System dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Patterns**.
    * On the **Virtual System Patterns** page, use the Search field to find the pattern you created, and then select the pattern.

    * Log in to the Console with admin user and password specified in step 3 or step 9.

    If the console does not display the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtimes, restart the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime node from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console. For instructions about restarting the runtime node from the administrative console, see [Restarting the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console](#restarting-the-mobilefirst-foundation-runtime-from-the-websphere-application-server-administrative-console).

### {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime synchronization limitation with WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment
{: #mobilefirst-foundation-runtime-synchronization-limitation-with-websphere-application-server-network-deployment }
If you deploy a PureApplication  pattern based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) template and run the System Monitoring for WebSphere  Application Server shared service, the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime environment might fail to start correctly, when you deploy the pattern.

A PureApplication virtual system pattern based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) template deploys the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service and the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime into different WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment clusters. For the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime to work correctly, it must be started after the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service. If the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime starts first, the runtime service fails to detect the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service, which causes errors in the runtime service.

When the deployment of a PureApplication pattern is almost complete, the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service restarts all of the WebSphere Application Server nodes that are deployed from the pattern. The nodes restart in a random order, so the nodes that contain the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime might be restarted before the nodes that contain the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service.

You must stop the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service before you deploy the pattern. If you cannot stop the shared service, you might need to restart the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console to fix the problem.

### Restarting the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console
{: #restarting-the-mobilefirst-foundation-runtime-from-the-websphere-application-server-administrative-console }
If your {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} is empty after you deploy a PureApplication  System pattern based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) template, you might need to restart the IBM {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime from the WebSphere  Application Server administrative console.

This procedure applies only when you are deploying PureApplication virtual system patterns based on the {{ site.data.keys.product }} (WAS ND) template when you are running the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service. If you do not use this shared service or are deploying a pattern based on a different template, this procedure does not apply to you.

You must deploy your pattern before you do this procedure.

To work correctly, the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service nodes must be started before the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime nodes. If the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service is running when you deploy a pattern, the shared service restarts all of the WebSphere Application Server nodes that are deployed from the pattern. The nodes restart in a random order, which means that the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime nodes might be started before the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration service nodes.

1. Confirm that the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service is deployed and running:
    * In the PureApplication System dashboard, click Patterns and then under Pattern Instances, click Shared Services.

        > **Important:** Shared Services appears twice in the **Patterns** menu, ensure that you click **Shared Services** under **Pattern Instances** and not under Patterns.
    * On the **Shared Service Instances** page, look for a name that starts with **System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server**. Click that name to expand its entry
    
        If you do not see an entry for **System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server**, the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service is not deployed and you do not need to continue with this procedure.
    * Check the **Status** column for the service.
    
        If **Status** says `Stopped`, the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service is stopped and you do not need to continue with this procedure.  
        If **Status** says `Started`, the System Monitoring for WebSphere Application Server shared service is running. Continue with the rest of this procedure.

2. Confirm that your pattern is running, and access the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} from the PureApplication System dashboard.

    For instructions about how access the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} from the PureApplication System dashboard, see step 10 in [Deploying {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} on clusters of WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment servers](#deploying-mobilefirst-server-on-clusters-of-websphere-application-server-network-deployment-servers).
    
3. If the console appears empty or is otherwise not displaying {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtimes, restart the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime node from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console:
    * In the **PureApplication System** dashboard, click **Patterns → Virtual System Instances**.
    * On the **Virtual System Instances** page, find your pattern instance and confirm that it is running. If it is not running, start the pattern instance.
    * Click the name of your pattern instance and in the details panel, find the **Virtual machine perspective** section.
    * In the **Virtual machine perspective** section, find the virtual machine whose name starts with **DmgrNode** and note its public IP address.
    * Open the WebSphere Application Server administrative console at the following URL:
    
        ```bash
        https://{DmgrNode VM public IP address}:9043/ibm/console
        ```
    
        Use the user ID and password that you specified for the WebSphere Application Server administrative console when you deployed the pattern.
    * In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, expand **Applications** and click **All applications**.
    * Restart the {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime:
        * In the list of applications, select the application with name that begins with IBM\_Worklight\_project\_runtime\_MFP.
        * In the **Action** column, select **Stop**.
        * Click **Submit Action**.
        * Wait until the application status in the **Status** column shows the stopped icon.
        * In the **Action** column, select **Start**.
        * Click S**ubmit Action**.

        Repeat this step for each {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtime application in the list.

4. Access the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }} again and confirm that your {{ site.data.keys.product }} runtimes are now visible.

## Deploying {{ site.data.keys.mf_app_center }} on a single-node WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server
{: #deploying-mobilefirst-application-center-on-a-single-node-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile-server }
You use a predefined template to deploy {{ site.data.keys.mf_app_center }} on a single-node WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile server.

This procedure involves uploading certain artifacts to IBM  PureApplication  System such as the required application and adapter. Before you begin, ensure that the artifacts are available for upload.

**Token licensing requirements:** If you use token licensing to license {{ site.data.keys.product }}, review the requirements that are outlined in [Token licensing requirements for {{ site.data.keys.mf_system_pattern }}](#token-licensing-requirements-for-mobilefirst-system-pattern) before you continue. If the license key server cannot be contacted or if insufficient license tokens are available then the deployment of this pattern fails.

Some parameters of script packages in the template is configured with the recommended values and are not mentioned here. For fine-tuning purposes, see more information about all the parameters of script packages in [Script packages for {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](#script-packages-for-mobilefirst-server).

For more information about the composition and configuration options of the predefined template that is used in this procedure, see [{{ site.data.keys.mf_app_center }} (Liberty single node) template](#mobilefirst-application-center-liberty-single-node-template).

## Configuring {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration security with an external LDAP repository
{: #configuring-mobilefirst-administration-security-with-an-external-ldap-repository }
You can configure {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration security to enable connecting out to an external LDAP repository. The configuration is common for both WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile and full profile.

This procedure involves configuring the LDAP parameters for connecting to the external user registry server. Before you begin, ensure the LDAP server is working and consult your LDAP administrator to obtain the required configuration information.

**Important:**  
When the LDAP repository configuration is enabled, a default user for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} administration is not automatically created. Instead, you must specify the administration user name and password that are stored in the LDAP repository. This information is required by WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile and a server farm of WebSphere Application Server full profile.

If the runtime to be deployed in the pattern is configured to use LDAP for application authentication, make sure that the LDAP server configured in the runtime is the same as the LDAP server that is configured for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration; different LDAP servers are not supported. Also, the protocol and port for LDAP connection must be identical. For example, if connections from the runtime to the LDAP server are configured to use the SSL protocol and port is 636, connections from the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Administration to the LDAP server must use the SSL protocol and port 636 as well.

1. Build a pattern with any topology you need. For more information, see the following topics:
