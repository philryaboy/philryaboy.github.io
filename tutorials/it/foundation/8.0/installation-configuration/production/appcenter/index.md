## Overview
{: #overview }
You install the Application Center as part of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installation.
You can install it with one of the following methods:

* Installation with IBM  Installation Manager
* Installation with Ant tasks
* Manual installation

Optionally, you can create the database of your choice before you install {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with the Application Center.  
After you installed the Application Center in the web application server of your choice, you have additional configuration to do. For more information, see Configuring Application Center after installation below. If you chose a manual setup in the installer, see the documentation of the server of your choice.

> **Note:** If you intend to install applications on iOS devices through the Application Center, you must first configure the Application Center server with SSL.

For a list of installed files and tools, see [Distribution structure of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}](../installation-manager/#distribution-structure-of-mobilefirst-server).

## Installing Application Center with IBM Installation Manager
{: #installing-application-center-with-ibm-installation-manager }
With IBM  Installation Manager, you can install Application Center, create its database, and deploy it on an Application Server.  
Before you begin, verify that the user who runs IBM Installation Manager has the privileges that are described in [File system prerequisites](../prod-env/appserver/#file-system-prerequisites).

To install IBM Application Center with IBM Installation Manager, complete the followings steps.

1. Optional: You can manually create databases for Application Center, as described in [Optional creation of databases](#optional-creation-of-databases) below. IBM Installation Manager can create the Application Center databases for you with default settings.
2. Run IBM Installation Manager, as described in [Running IBM Installation Manager](../installation-manager).
3. Select **Yes** to the question **Install IBM Application Center**.

* [Default logins and passwords created by IBM Installation Manager for the Application Center](#default-logins-and-passwords-created-by-ibm-installation-manager-for-the-application-center)

### Optional creation of databases
{: #optional-creation-of-databases }
If you want to activate the option to install the Application Center when you run the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer, you need to have certain database access rights that entitle you to create the tables that are required by the Application Center.

If you have sufficient database administration credentials, and if you enter the administrator user name and password in the installer when prompted, the installer can create the databases for you. Otherwise, you need to ask your database administrator to create the required database for you. The database needs to be created before you start the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer.

The following topics describe the procedure for the supported database management systems.

* [Creating the DB2 database for Application Center](#creating-the-db2-database-for-application-center)
* [Creating the MySQL database for Application Center](#creating-the-mysql-database-for-application-center)
* [Creating the Oracle database for Application Center](#creating-the-oracle-database-for-application-center)

#### Creating the DB2 database for Application Center
{: #creating-the-db2-database-for-application-center }
During IBM MobileFirst Foundation installation, the installer can create the Application Center database for you.

The installer can create the Application Center database for you if you enter the name and password of a user account on the database server that has the DB2  SYSADM or SYSCTRL privilege, and the account can be accessed through SSH. Otherwise, the database administrator can create the Application Center database for you. For more information, see the [DB2 Solution](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.sec.doc/doc/c0055206.html) user documentation.

When you manually create the database, you can replace the database name (here APPCNTR) and the password with a database name and password of your choosing.

> **Important:** You can name your database and user differently, or set a different password, but ensure that you enter the appropriate database name, user name, and password correctly across the DB2 database setup. DB2 has a database name limit of 8 characters on all platforms, and has a user name and password length limit of 8 characters for UNIX and Linux systems, and 30 characters for Windows.

1. Create a system user, for example, named **wluser** in a DB2 admin group such as **DB2USERS**, using the appropriate commands for your operating system. Give it a password, for example, **wluser**. If you want multiple instances of IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to connect to the same database, use a different user name for each connection. Each database user has a separate default schema. For more information about database users, see the DB2 documentation and the documentation for your operating system.

2. Open a DB2 command line processor, with a user that has **SYSADM** or **SYSCTRL** permissions:

    * On Windows systems, click **Start → IBM DB2 → Command Line Processor**
    * On Linux or UNIX systems, navigate to **~/sqllib/bin** and enter `./db2`.
    * Enter database manager and SQL statements similar to the following example to create the Application Center database, replacing the user name **wluser** with your chosen user names:

      ```bash
      CREATE DATABASE APPCNTR COLLATE USING SYSTEM PAGESIZE 32768
      CONNECT TO APPCNTR
      GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE TO USER wluser
      DISCONNECT APPCNTR
      QUIT
      ```

3. The installer can create the database tables and objects for Application Center in a specific schema. This allows you to use the same database for Application Center and for a MobileFirst project. If the IMPLICIT\_SCHEMA authority is granted to the user created in step 1 (the default in the database creation script in step 2), no further action is required. If the user does not have the IMPLICIT\_SCHEMA authority, you need to create a SCHEMA for the Application Center database tables and objects.

#### Creating the MySQL database for Application Center
{: #creating-the-mysql-database-for-application-center }
During the MobileFirst installation, the installer can create the Application Center database for you.

The installer can create the database for you if you enter the name and password of the superuser account. For more information, see [Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/default-privileges.html) on your MySQL database server. Your database administrator can also create the databases for you. When you manually create the database, you can replace the database name (here APPCNTR) and password with a database name and password of your choosing. Note that MySQL database names are case-sensitive on UNIX.

1. Start the MySQL command-line tool.
2. Enter the following commands:

   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE APPCNTR CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON APPCNTR.* TO 'worklight'@'Worklight-host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON APPCNTR.* TO 'worklight'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Here, you need to replace **Worklight-host** with the name of the host on which IBM MobileFirst Foundation runs.

#### Creating the Oracle database for Application Center
{: #creating-the-oracle-database-for-application-center }
During the installation, the installer can create the Application Center database, except for the Oracle 12c database type, or the user and schema inside an existing database for you.

The installer can create the database, except for the Oracle 12c database type, or the user and schema inside an existing database if you enter the name and password of the Oracle administrator on the database server, and the account can be accessed through SSH. Otherwise, the database administrator can create the database or user and schema for you. When you manually create the database or user, you can use database names, user names, and a password of your choosing. Note that lowercase characters in Oracle user names can lead to trouble.

1. If you do not already have a database named **ORCL**, use the Oracle Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA) and follow the steps in the wizard to create a new general-purpose database named **ORCL**:
    * Use global database name **ORCL\_your\_domain**, and system identifier (SID) **ORCL**.
    * On the **Custom Scripts** tab of the step **Database Content**, do not run the SQL scripts, because you must first create a user account.
    * On the **Character Sets** tab of the step **Initialization Parameters**, select **Use Unicode (AL32UTF8) character set and UTF8 - Unicode 3.0 UTF-8 national character set**.
    * Complete the procedure, accepting the default values.
2. Create a database user either by using **Oracle Database Control**, or by using the **Oracle SQLPlu**s command-line interpreter.
    * Using **Oracle Database Control**:
        * Connect as **SYSDBA**.
        * Go to the **Users** page: click **Server**, then **Users** in the **Security** section.
        * Create a user, for example, named **APPCENTER**. If you want multiple instances of IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to connect to the same general-purpose database you created in step 1, use a different user name for each connection. Each database user has a separate default schema.
        * Assign the following attributes:
            * Profile: **DEFAULT**
            * Authentication: **password**
            * Default tablespace: **USERS**
            * Temporary tablespace: **TEMP**
            * Status: **Unlocked**
            * Add system privilege: **CREATE SESSION**
            * Add system privilege: **CREATE SEQUENCE**
            * Add system privilege: **CREATE TABLE**
            * Add quota: **Unlimited for tablespace USERS**
    * Using the **Oracle SQLPlus** command-line interpreter:  
    The commands in the following example create a user named APPCENTER for the database:

        ```bash
        CONNECT SYSTEM/<SYSTEM_password>@ORCL
        CREATE USER APPCENTER IDENTIFIED BY password DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;
        GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TABLE TO APPCENTER;
        DISCONNECT;
        ```

### Installing Application Center in WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment
{: #installing-application-center-in-websphere-application-server-network-deployment }
To install Application Center in a set of WebSphere  Application Server Network Deployment servers, run IBM  Installation Manager on the machine where the deployment manager is running.

1. When IBM Installation Manager prompts you to specify the database type, select any option other than **Apache Derby**. IBM MobileFirst Foundation supports Apache Derby only in embedded mode, and this choice is incompatible with deployment through WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment.
2. In the installer panel in which you specify the WebSphere Application Server installation directory, select the deployment manager profile.

    > **Attention:** Do not select an application server profile and then a single managed server: doing so causes the deployment manager to overwrite the configuration of the server regardless of whether you install on the machine on which the deployment manager is running or on a different machine.
3. Select the required scope depending on where you want Application Center to be installed. The following table lists the available scopes:

    | Scope	 | Explanation |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Cell	 | Installs Application Center in all application servers of the cell. |
    | Cluster| Installs Application Center in all application servers of the specified cluster. |
    | Node   | (excluding clusters)	Installs Application Center in all application servers of the specified node that are not in a cluster. |
    | Server | Installs Application Center in the specified server, which is not in a cluster. |

4. Restart the target servers by following the procedure in [Completing the installation](#completing-the-installation) below.

The installation has no effect outside the set of servers in the specified scope. The JDBC providers and JDBC data sources are defined with the specified scope. The entities that have a cell-wide scope (the applications and, for DB2 , the authentication alias) have a suffix in their name that makes them unique. So, you can install Application Center in different configurations or even different versions of Application Center, in different clusters of the same cell.

> **Note:** Because the JDBC driver is installed only in the specified set of application servers, the Test connection button for the JDBC data sources in the WebSphere Application Server administration console of the deployment manager might not work.

If you use a front-end HTTP server, you need to configure the public URL as well.

### Completing the installation
{: #completing-the-installation }
When installation is complete, you must restart the web application server in certain cases.  
You must restart the web application server in the following circumstances:

* When you are using WebSphere  Application Server with DB2  as database type.
* When you are using WebSphere Application Server and have opened it without the application security enabled before you installed IBM MobileFirst Application Center or {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.

The MobileFirst installer must activate the application security of WebSphere Application Server (if not active yet) to install Application Center. Then, for this activation to take place, restart the application server after the installation of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} completed.

* When you are using WebSphere Application Server Liberty or Apache Tomcat.
* After you upgraded from a previous version of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.

If you are using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment and chose an installation through the deployment manager:

* You must restart the servers that were running during the installation and on which the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} web applications are installed.

To restart these servers with the deployment manager console, select **Applications → Application Types → WebSphere enterprise applications → IBM_Application\_Center\_Services → Target specific application status**.

* You do not have to restart the deployment manager or the node agents.

> **Note:** Only the Application Center is installed in the application server.

### Default logins and passwords created by IBM Installation Manager for the Application Center
{: #default-logins-and-passwords-created-by-ibm-installation-manager-for-the-application-center }
IBM  Installation Manager creates the logins by default for the Application Center, according to your application server. You can use these logins to test the Application Center.

#### WebSphere Application Server full profile
{: #websphere-application-server-full-profile }
The login **appcenteradmin** is created with a password that is generated and displayed during the installation.

All users authenticated in the application realm are also authorized to access the **appcenteradmin** role. This is not meant for a production environment, especially if WebSphere  Application Server is configured with a single security domain.

For more information about how to modify these logins, see [Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server full profile](#configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-full-profile).

#### WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile
{: #websphere-application-server-liberty-profile }
* The login demo is created in the basicRegistry with the password demo.
* The login appcenteradmin is created in the basicRegistry with the password admin.

For more information about how to modify these logins, see [Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile](#configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile).

#### Apache Tomcat
{: #apache-tomcat }
* The login demo is created with the password demo.
* The login guest is created with the password guest.
* The login appcenteradmin is created with the password admin.

For more information about how to modify these logins, see [Configuring the Java EE security roles on Apache Tomcat](#configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-apache-tomcat).

## Installing the Application Center with Ant tasks
{: #installing-the-application-center-with-ant-tasks }
Learn about the Ant tasks that you can use to install Application Center.

#### Jump to
{: #jump-to-3 }

* [Creating and configuring the database for Application Center with Ant tasks](#creating-and-configuring-the-database-for-application-center-with-ant-tasks)
* [Deploying the Application Center Console and Services with Ant tasks](#deploying-the-application-center-console-and-services-with-ant-tasks)

### Creating and configuring the database for Application Center with Ant tasks
{: #creating-and-configuring-the-database-for-application-center-with-ant-tasks }
If you did not manually create the database, you can use Ant tasks to create and configure your database for Application Center. If your database already exists, you can perform only the configuration steps with Ant tasks.

Before you begin, make sure that a database management system (DBMS) is installed and running on a database server, which can be on the same computer, or a different one.

The Ant tasks for Application Center are in the **ApplicationCenter/configuration-samples** directory of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} distribution.

If you want to start the Ant task from a computer where {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is not installed, you must copy the following files to that computer:

* The library **mf\_server\_install\_dir/MobileFirstServer/mfp-ant-deployer.jar**
* The directory that contains binary files of the aapt program, from the Android SDK platform-tools package: **mf\_server\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk**
* The Ant sample files that are in **mf\_server\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/configuration-samples**

> **Note:** The **mf\_server\_install\_dir** placeholder represents the directory where you installed {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.

If you did not create your database manually, as described in [Optional creation of databases](#optional-creation-of-databases), follow steps 1 to 3 below.
If your database already exists, you must create only the database tables. Follow steps 4 to 7 below.

1. Copy the sample Ant file that corresponds to your DBMS. The files for creating a database are named after the following pattern:

    ```bash
    create-appcenter-database-<dbms>.xml
    ```

2. Edit the Ant file, and replace the placeholder values with the properties at the beginning of the file.
3. Run the following commands to create the Application Center database:

    ```bash
    ant -f create-appcenter-database-<dbms>.xml databases
    ```

    You can find the Ant command in **mf\_server\_install\_dir/shortcuts**.

    If the database already exists, then you must create only the database tables by completing the following steps:

4. Copy the sample Ant file that corresponds to both your application server, and your DBMS. The files for configuring an existing database are named after this pattern:

    ```bash
    configure-appcenter-<appServer>-<dbms>.xml
    ```

5. Edit the Ant file, and replace the placeholder values with the properties at the beginning of the file.
6. Run the following commands to configure the database:

    ```bash
    ant -f configure-appcenter-<appServer>-<dbms>.xml databases
    ```

    You can find the Ant command in **mf\_server\_install\_dir/shortcuts**.

7. Save the Ant file. You might need it later to apply a fix pack, or perform an upgrade.

If you do not want to save the passwords, you can replace them by "************" (12 stars) for interactive prompting.

### Deploying the Application Center Console and Services with Ant tasks
{: #deploying-the-application-center-console-and-services-with-ant-tasks }
Use Ant tasks to deploy the Application Center Console and Services to an application server, and configure data sources, properties, and database drivers that are used by Application Center.

Before you begin,

* Complete the procedure at [Creating and configuring the database for Application Center with Ant tasks](#creating-and-configuring-the-database-for-application-center-with-ant-tasks).
* You must run the Ant task on the computer where the application server is installed, or the Network Deployment Manager for WebSphere  Application Server Network Deployment. If you want to start the Ant task from a computer where {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} is not installed, you must copy the following files and directories to that computer:

    * The library **mf\_server\_install\_dir/MobileFirstServer/mfp-ant-deployer.jar**
    * The web applications (WAR and EAR files) in **mf_server\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/console**
    * The directory that contains the binary files of the aapt program, from the Android SDK platform-tools package: **mf\_server\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk**
    * The Ant sample files that are in **mf\_server\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/configuration-samples**

> **Note:** The mf_server_install_dir placeholder represents the directory where you installed {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.

1. Copy the Ant file that corresponds both to your application server, and your DBMS. The files for configuring Application Center are named after the following pattern:

    ```bash
    configure-appcenter-<appserver>-<dbms>.xml
    ```

2. Edit the Ant file, and replace the placeholder values with the properties at the beginning of the file.
3. Run the following command to deploy the Application Center Console and Services to an application server:

    ```bash
    ant -f configure-appcenter-<appserver>-<dbms>.xml install
    ```

    You can find the Ant command in **mf\_server\_install\_dir/shortcuts**.

    > **Note:** With these Ant files, you can also do the following actions:
    >
    > * Uninstall Application Center, with the target **uninstall**.
    > * Update Application Center with the target **minimal-update**, to apply a fix pack.

4. Save the Ant file. You might need it later to apply a fix pack or perform an upgrade. If you do not want to save the passwords, you can replace them by "************" (12 stars) for interactive prompting.
5. If you installed on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, or Apache Tomcat, check that the aapt program is executable for all users. If needed, you must set the proper user rights. For example, on UNIX / Linux systems:

    ```bash
    chmod a+x mf_server_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk/*/aapt*
    ```

## Manually installing Application Center
{: #manually-installing-application-center }
A reconfiguration is necessary for the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} to use a database or schema that is different from the one that was specified during its installation. This reconfiguration depends on the type of database and on the kind of application server.

On application servers other than Apache Tomcat, you can deploy Application Center from two WAR files or one EAR file.

> **Restriction:** Whether you install Application Center with IBM  Installation Manager as part of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installation or manually, remember that "rolling updates" of Application Center are not supported. That is, you cannot install two versions of Application Center (for example, V5.0.6 and V6.0.0) that operate on the same database.

### Configuring the DB2 database manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-the-db2-database-manually-for-application-center }
You configure the DB2  database manually by creating the database, creating the database tables, and then configuring the relevant application server to use this database setup.

1. Create the database. This step is described in [Creating the DB2 database for Application Center](#creating-the-db2-database-for-application-center).
2. Create the tables in the database. This step is described in [Setting up your DB2 database manually for Application Center](#setting-up-your-db2-database-manually-for-application-center).
3. Perform the application server-specific setup as the following list shows.

##### Setting up your DB2 database manually for Application Center
{: #setting-up-your-db2-database-manually-for-application-center }
Set up your DB2 database for Application Center by creating the database schema.

1. Create a system user, **worklight**, in a DB2 admin group such as **DB2USERS**, by using the appropriate commands for your operating system. Give it the password **worklight**. For more information, see the DB2 documentation and the documentation for your operating system.

> **Important:** You can name your user differently, or set a different password, but ensure that you enter the appropriate user name and password correctly across the DB2 database setup. DB2 has a user name and password length limit of 8 characters for UNIX and Linux systems, and 30 characters for Windows.

2. Open a DB2 command line processor, with a user that has **SYSADM** or **SYSCTRL** permissions:
    * On Windows systems, click **Start → IBM DB2 → Command Line Processor**.
    * On Linux or UNIX systems, go to **~/sqllib/bin** and enter `./db2`.

3. Enter the following database manager and SQL statements to create a database that is called **APPCNTR**:

   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE APPCNTR COLLATE USING SYSTEM PAGESIZE 32768
   CONNECT TO APPCNTR
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE TO USER worklight
   QUIT
   ```

4. Run DB2 with the following commands to create the **APPCNTR** tables, in a schema named **APPSCHM** (the name of the schema can be changed). This command can be run on an existing database that has a page size compatible with the one defined in step 3.

   ```bash
   db2 CONNECT TO APPCNTR
   db2 SET CURRENT SCHEMA = 'APPSCHM'
   db2 -vf product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/databases/create-appcenter-db2.sql -t
   ```

##### Configuring Liberty profile for DB2 manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-liberty-profile-for-db2-manually-for-application-center }
You can set up and configure your DB2  database manually for Application Center with WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile.  
Complete the DB2 Database Setup procedure before continuing.

1. Add the DB2 JDBC driver JAR file to **$LIBERTY\_HOME/wlp/usr/shared/resources/db2**.

    If that directory does not exist, create it. You can retrieve the file in one of two ways:
    * Download it from [DB2 JDBC Driver Versions](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866).
    * Fetch it from the **db2\_install\_dir/java** on the DB2 server directory.

2. Configure the data source in the **$LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/worklightServer/server.xml** file as follows:

   In this path, you can replace **worklightServer** by the name of your server.

   ```xml
   <library id="DB2Lib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}/db2" includes="*.jar"/>
   </library>

   <!-- Declare the IBM Application Center database. -->
   <dataSource jndiName="jdbc/AppCenterDS" transactional="false">
      <jdbcDriver libraryRef="DB2Lib"/>
      <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="APPCNTR"  currentSchema="APPSCHM"
            serverName="db2server" portNumber="50000"
            user="worklight" password="worklight"/>
   </dataSource>
   ```

   The **worklight** placeholder after **user=** is the name of the system user with **CONNECT** access to the **APPCNTR** database that you have previously created.  

   The **worklight** placeholder after **password=** is this user's password. If you have defined either a different user name, or a different password, or both, replace **worklight** accordingly. Also, replace **db2server** with the host name of your DB2 server (for example, **localhost**, if it is on the same computer).

   DB2 has a user name and password length limit of 8 characters for UNIX and Linux systems, and 30 characters for Windows.

3. You can encrypt the database password with the securityUtility program in **liberty\_install\_dir/bin**.

##### Configuring WebSphere Application Server for DB2 manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-for-db2-manually-for-application-center }
You can set up and configure your DB2  database manually for Application Center with WebSphere  Application Server.

1. Determine a suitable directory for the JDBC driver JAR file in the WebSphere Application Server installation directory.
    * For a stand-alone server, you can use a directory such as **was\_install\_dir/optionalLibraries/IBM/Worklight/db2**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND cell, use **was\_install\_dir/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/Worklight/db2**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND cluster, use **was\_install\_dir/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/clusters/cluster-name/Worklight/db2**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND node, use **was\_install\_dir/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/Worklight/db2**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND server, use **was\_install\_dir/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/servers/server-name/Worklight/db2**.

    If this directory does not exist, create it.

##### Configuring Apache Tomcat for DB2 manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-apache-tomcat-for-db2-manually-for-application-center }
If you want to manually set up and configure your DB2  database for Application Center with Apache Tomcat server, use the following procedure.  
Before you continue, complete the DB2 database setup procedure.

1. Add the DB2 JDBC driver JAR file.

    You can retrieve this JAR file in one of the following ways:
    * Download it from [DB2 JDBC Driver Versions](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866).
    * Or fetch it from the directory **db2\_install\_dir/java** on the DB2 server) to **$TOMCAT_HOME/lib**.

2. Prepare an XML statement that defines the data source, as shown in the following code example.

   ```xml
   <Resource auth="Container"
            driverClassName="com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
            name="jdbc/AppCenterDS"
            username="worklight"
            password="password"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            url="jdbc:db2://server:50000/APPCNTR:currentSchema=APPSCHM;"/>
   ```

   The **worklight** parameter after **username=** is the name of the system user with "CONNECT" access to the **APPCNTR** database that you have previously created. The **password** parameter after **password=** is this user's password. If you have defined either a different user name, or a different password, or both, replace these entries accordingly.

   DB2 enforces limits on the length of user names and passwords.
    * For UNIX and Linux systems: 8 characters
    * For Windows: 30 characters

3. Insert this statement in the server.xml file, as indicated in [Configuring Apache Tomcat for Application Center manually](#configuring-apache-tomcat-for-application-center-manually).

##### Setting up your Oracle database manually for Application Center
{: #setting-up-your-oracle-database-manually-for-application-center }
Complete the following procedure to set up your Oracle database.

1. Ensure that you have at least one Oracle database.

    In many Oracle installations, the default database has the SID (name) ORCL. For best results, specify **Unicode (AL32UTF8)** as the character set of the database.

    If the Oracle installation is on a UNIX or Linux computer, make sure that the database is started next time the Oracle installation is restarted. To this effect, make sure that the line in /etc/oratab that corresponds to the database ends with a Y, not with an N.

2. Create the user APPCENTER, either by using Oracle Database Control, or by using the Oracle SQLPlus command-line interpreter.
    * To create the user for the Application Center database/schema, by using Oracle Database Control, proceed as follows:
        * Connect as **SYSDBA**.
        * Go to the Users page.
        * Click **Server**, then **Users** in the Security section.
        * Create a user, named **APPCENTER** with the following attributes:

      ```bash
      Profile: DEFAULT
      Authentication: password
      Default tablespace: USERS
      Temporary tablespace: TEMP
      Status: Unlocked
      Add system privilege: CREATE SESSION
      Add system privilege: CREATE SEQUENCE
      Add system privilege: CREATE TABLE
      Add quota: Unlimited for tablespace USERS
      ```
    * To create the user by using Oracle SQLPlus, enter the following commands:

      ```bash
      CONNECT SYSTEM/<SYSTEM_password>@ORCL
      CREATE USER APPCENTER IDENTIFIED BY password DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;
      GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TABLE TO APPCENTER;
      DISCONNECT;
      ```

3. Create the tables for the Application Center database:
    * Using the Oracle SQLPlus command-line interpreter, create the tables for the Application Center database by running the **create-appcenter-oracle.sql** file:

   ```bash
   CONNECT APPCENTER/APPCENTER_password@ORCL
   @product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/databases/create-appcenter-oracle.sql
   DISCONNECT;
   ```

4. Download and configure the Oracle JDBC driver:
    * Download the JDBC driver from the Oracle website at [Oracle: JDBC, SQLJ, Oracle JPublisher and Universal Connection Pool (UCP)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html).
    * Ensure that the Oracle JDBC driver is in the system path. The driver file is **ojdbc6.jar**.

                         user="APPCENTER" password="APPCENTER_password"/>
   </dataSource>
   ```

   Where:
    * **APPCENTER** after **user=** is the user name,
    * **APPCENTER_password** after **password=** is this user's password, and
    * **oserver** is the host name of your Oracle server (for example, localhost if it is on the same machine).

    > **Note:** For more information on how to connect the Liberty server to the Oracle database with a service name, or with a URL, see the [WebSphere Application Server Liberty Core 8.5.5 documentation](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/autodita/rwlp_metatype_core.html?cp=SSD28V_8.5.5%2F1-5-0), section **properties.oracle**.

##### Configuring WebSphere Application Server for Oracle manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-for-oracle-manually-for-application-center }
If you want to manually set up and configure your Oracle database for Application Center with WebSphere  Application Server, use the following procedure. Complete the Oracle database setup procedure before continuing.

1. Determine a suitable directory for the JDBC driver JAR file in the WebSphere Application Server installation directory.
    * For a standalone server, you can use a directory such as WAS_INSTALL_DIR/optionalLibraries/IBM/Worklight/oracle.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND cell, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/Worklight/oracle**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND cluster, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/clusters/cluster-name/Worklight/oracle**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND node, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/Worklight/oracle**.
    * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server ND server, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/servers/server-name/Worklight/oracle**.

    If this is directory does not exist, create it.

2. Add the Oracle ﻿**ojdbc6.jar** file downloaded from [JDBC and Universal Connection Pool (UCP)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html) to the directory determined in step 1.
3. Set up the JDBC provider:
    * In the WebSphere Application Server console, click **Resources → JDBC → JDBC Providers**.
    * Select the appropriate scope from the **Scope** combination box.
    * Click **New**.
    * Complete the **JDBC Provider** fields as indicated in the following table:

        | Field | Value |
        |-------|-------|
        | Databasetype | Oracle |
        | Provider type | Oracle JDBC Driver |
        | Implementation type | Connection pool data source |
        | Name | Oracle JDBC Driver |
    * Click **Next**.
    * Set the **class path** to the JAR file in the directory determined in step 1, replacing **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name** with the WebSphere Application Server variable reference **${USER_INSTALL_ROOT}**
    * Click **Next**.

    The JDBC provider is created.

4. Create a data source for the Worklight database:
    * Click **Resources → JDBC → Data sources**.
    * Select the appropriate scope from the **Scope** combination box.
    * Click **New**.
    * Set **Data source name** to **Oracle JDBC Driver DataSource**.
    * Set **JNDI name** to **jdbc/AppCenterDS**.
    * Click **Next**.
    * Click **Select an existing JDBC provider** and select **Oracle JDBC driver** from the list.
    * Click **Next**.
    * Set the **URL** value to **jdbc:oracle:thin:@oserver:1521:ORCL**, where **oserver** is the host name of your Oracle server (for example, **localhost**, if it is on the same machine).
    * Click **Next** twice.
    * Click **Resources → JDBC → Data sources → Oracle JDBC Driver DataSource → Custom properties**.
    * Set **oracleLogPackageName** to **oracle.jdbc.driver**.
    * Set **user = APPCENTER**.
    * Set **password = APPCENTER_password**.
    * Click **OK** and save the changes.
    * In **Resources → JDBC → Data sources**, select the new data source.
    * Click **WebSphere Application Server data source properties**.
    * Select the **Non-transactional data source** check box.
    * Click **OK**.
    * Click **Save**.

##### Configuring Apache Tomcat for Oracle manually for Application Center
{: #configuring-apache-tomcat-for-oracle-manually-for-application-center }
If you want to manually set up and configure your Oracle database for Application Center with the Apache Tomcat server, use the following procedure. Complete the Oracle database setup procedure before continuing.

1. Add the Oracle JDBC driver JAR file to the directory **$TOMCAT_HOME/lib**.
2. Prepare an XML statement that defines the data source, as shown in the following code example. Insert this statement in the server.xml file, as indicated in [Configuring Apache Tomcat for Application Center manually](#configuring-apache-tomcat-for-application-center-manually)

```xml
<Resource name="jdbc/AppCenterDS"
        auth="Container"
        type="javax.sql.DataSource"
        driverClassName="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
        url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@oserver:1521:ORCL"
        username="APPCENTER"
        password="APPCENTER_password"/>
```

Where **APPCENTER** after **username=** is the name of the system user with "CONNECT" access to the **APPCNTR** database that you have previously created, and **APPCENTER_password** after password= is this user's password. If you have defined either a different user name, or a different password, or both, replace these values accordingly.

### Deploying the Application Center WAR files and configuring the application server manually
{: #deploying-the-application-center-war-files-and-configuring-the-application-server-manually }
The procedure to manually deploy the Application Center WAR files manually to an application server depends on the type of application server being configured.  
These manual instructions assume that you are familiar with your application server.

> **Note:** Using the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer to install Application Center is more reliable than installing manually, and should be used whenever possible.

If you prefer to use the manual process, follow these steps to configure your application server for Application Center. You must deploy the appcenterconsole.war and applicationcenter.war files to your Application Center. The files are located in **product\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/console**.

* [Configuring Apache Tomcat for Application Center manually](#configuring-apache-tomcat-for-application-center-manually)

##### Configuring the Liberty profile for Application Center manually
{: #configuring-the-liberty-profile-for-application-center-manually }
To configure WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile manually for Application Center, you must modify the **server.xml** file.  
In addition to modifications for the databases that are described in [Manually installing Application Center](#manually-installing-application-center), you must make the following modifications to the **server.xml** file.

1. Ensure that the `<featureManager>` element contains at least the following `<feature>` elements:

   ```xml
   <feature>jdbc-4.0</feature>
   <feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-3.0</feature>
   <feature>usr:MFPDecoderFeature-1.0</feature>
   ```

2. Add the following declarations for Application Center:

   ```xml
   <!-- The directory with binaries of the 'aapt' program, from the Android SDK's
         platform-tools package. -->
   <jndiEntry jndiName="android.aapt.dir" value="product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk"/>
   <!-- Declare the Application Center Console application. -->
   <application id="appcenterconsole"
                 name="appcenterconsole"
                 location="appcenterconsole.war"
                 type="war">
      <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="appcenteradmin">
          <group name="appcentergroup"/>
        </security-role>
      </application-bnd>
      <classloader delegation="parentLast">
      </classloader>
   </application>

   <!-- Declare the IBM Application Center Services application. -->
   <application id="applicationcenter"
                 name="applicationcenter"
                 location="applicationcenter.war"
                 type="war">
      <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="appcenteradmin">
          <group name="appcentergroup"/>
        </security-role>
      </application-bnd>
      <classloader delegation="parentLast">           
      </classloader>
   </application>

   <!-- Declare the user registry for the IBM Application Center. -->
   <basicRegistry id="applicationcenter-registry"
                   realm="ApplicationCenter">
      <!-- The users defined here are members of group "appcentergroup",
           thus have role "appcenteradmin", and can therefore perform
           administrative tasks through the Application Center Console. -->
      <user name="appcenteradmin" password="admin"/>
      <user name="demo" password="demo"/>
      <group name="appcentergroup">
        <member name="appcenteradmin"/>
        <member name="demo"/>
      </group>
   </basicRegistry>
   ```

   The groups and users that are defined in the `basicRegistry` are example logins that you can use to test Application Center. Similarly, the groups that are defined in the `<security-role name="appcenteradmin">` for the Application Center console and the Application Center service are examples. For more information about how to modify these groups, see [Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile](#configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile).

3. If the database is Oracle, add the **commonLibraryRef** attribute to the class loader of the Application Center service application.

   ```xml
   ...
   <classloader delegation="parentLast"  commonLibraryRef="OracleLib">
   ...
   ```

   The name of the library reference (`OracleLib` in this example) must be the ID of the library that contains the JDBC JAR file. This ID is declared in the procedure that is documented in [Configuring Liberty profile for Oracle manually for Application Center](#configuring-liberty-profile-for-oracle-manually-for-application-center).

4. Copy the Application Center WAR files to your Liberty server.
    * On UNIX and Linux systems:

      ```bash
      mkdir -p LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/server_name/apps
      cp product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/console/*.war LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/server_name/apps/
      ```
    * On Windows systems:

      ```bash
      mmkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\servers\server_name\apps
      copy /B product_install_dir\ApplicationCenter\console\appcenterconsole.war
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\servers\server_name\apps\appcenterconsole.war
      copy /B product_install_dir\ApplicationCenter\console\applicationcenter.war
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\servers\server_name\apps\applicationcenter.war
      ```

5. Copy the password decoder user feature.
    * On UNIX and Linux systems:

      ```bash
      mkdir -p LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/features
      cp product_install_dir/features/com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/
      cp product_install_dir/features/MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/features/
      ```
    * On Windows systems:

      ```bash
      mkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib
      copy /B product_install_dir\features\com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar  
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar
      mkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\features
      copy /B product_install_dir\features\MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf  
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\features\MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf
      ```

6. Start the Liberty server.

### Deploying the Application Center EAR file and configuring the application server manually
{: #deploying-the-application-center-ear-file-and-configuring-the-application-server-manually }
As an alternative to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer procedure, you can use a manual procedure to deploy the Application Center EAR file and configure your WebSphere  application server manually. These manual instructions assume that you are familiar with your application server.

The procedure to deploy the Application Center EAR file manually to an application server depends on the type of application server. Manual deployment is supported only for WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile and WebSphere Application Server.

> **Tip:** It is more reliable to install Application Center through the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer than manually. Therefore, whenever possible, use the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installer. If, however, you prefer the manual procedure, deploy the **appcentercenter.ear** file, which you can find in the **product\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/console** directory.

#### Configuring the Liberty profile for Application Center manually
{: #configuring-the-liberty-profile-for-application-center-manually-1 }
After you deploy the Application Center EAR file, to configure WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile manually for Application Center, you must modify the server.xml file.

In addition to modifications for the databases that are described in [Manually installing Application Center](#manually-installing-application-center), you must make the following modifications to the **server.xml** file.

1. Ensure that the `<featureManager>` element contains at least the following `<feature>` elements:

   ```xml
   <feature>jdbc-4.0</feature>
   <feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-3.0</feature>
   <feature>usr:MFPDecoderFeature-1.0</feature>
   ```

2. Add the following declarations for Application Center:

   ```xml
   <!-- The directory with binaries of the 'aapt' program, from the Android SDK's platform-tools package. -->
   <jndiEntry jndiName="android.aapt.dir" value="product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk"/>

   <!-- Declare the IBM Application Center application. -->
   <application id="applicationcenter"
                 name="applicationcenter"
                 location="applicationcenter.ear"
                 type="ear">
      <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="appcenteradmin">
          <group name="appcentergroup"/>
        </security-role>
      </application-bnd>
      <classloader delegation="parentLast">           
      </classloader>
   </application>

   <!-- Declare the user registry for the IBM Application Center. -->
   <basicRegistry id="applicationcenter-registry"
                   realm="ApplicationCenter">
      <!-- The users defined here are members of group "appcentergroup",
           thus have role "appcenteradmin", and can therefore perform
           administrative tasks through the Application Center Console. -->
      <user name="appcenteradmin" password="admin"/>
      <user name="demo" password="demo"/>
      <group name="appcentergroup">
        <member name="appcenteradmin"/>
        <member name="demo"/>
      </group>
   </basicRegistry>
   ```

   The groups and users that are defined in the **basicRegistry** element are example logins, which you can use to test Application Center. Similarly, the groups that are defined in the `<security-role name="appcenteradmin">` element are examples. For more information about how to modify these groups, see [Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile](#configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile).

3. If the database is Oracle, add the **commonLibraryRef** attribute to the class loader of the Application Center application.

   ```xml
   ...
   <classloader delegation="parentLast"  commonLibraryRef="OracleLib">
   ...
   ```

   The name of the library reference (**OracleLib** in this example) must be the ID of the library that contains the JDBC JAR file. This ID is declared in the procedure that is documented in [Configuring Liberty profile for Oracle manually for Application Center](#configuring-liberty-profile-for-oracle-manually-for-application-center).

4. Copy the Application Center EAR files to your Liberty server.
    * On UNIX and Linux systems:

       ```bash
       mkdir -p LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/server_name/apps
       cp product_install_dir/ApplicationCenter/console/*.ear LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/servers/server_name/apps/
       ```

    * On Windows systems:

       ```bash
       mkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\servers\server_name\apps
       copy /B product_install_dir\ApplicationCenter\console\applicationcenter.ear
       LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\servers\server_name\apps\applicationcenter.ear
       ```

5. Copy the password decoder user feature.
    * On UNIX and Linux systems:

      ```bash
      mkdir -p LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/features
      cp product_install_dir/features/com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/
      cp product_install_dir/features/MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf LIBERTY_HOME/wlp/usr/extension/lib/features/
      ```
    * On Windows systems:

      ```bash
      mkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib
      copy /B product_install_dir\features\com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar  
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\com.ibm.websphere.crypto_1.0.0.jar
      mkdir LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\features
      copy /B product_install_dir\features\MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf  
      LIBERTY_HOME\wlp\usr\extension\lib\features\MFPDecoderFeature-1.0.mf
      ```

6. Start the Liberty server.

#### Configuring WebSphere Application Server for Application Center manually
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-for-application-center-manually-1 }
After you deploy the Application Center EAR file, to configure WebSphere  Application Server profile manually for Application Center, you must configure variables, custom properties, and class loader policies. Make sure that a WebSphere Application Server profile exists.

1. Log on to the WebSphere Application Server administration console for your IBM MobileFirst  Server.
2. Enable application security.
    * Click **Security → Global Security**.
    * Ensure that **Enable administrative security** is selected. Application security can be enabled only if administrative security is enabled.
    * Ensure that **Enable application security** is selected.
    * Click **OK**.
    * Save the changes.

    For more information, see [Enabling security](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tsec_csec2.html).

3. Create the Application Center JDBC data source and provider. See the appropriate section in [Manually installing Application Center](#manually-installing-application-center).
4. Install the Application Center console WAR file.
    * Depending on your version of WebSphere Application Server, click one of the following options:
        * **Applications → New → New Enterprise Application**
        * **Applications → New Application → New Enterprise Application**
    * Navigate to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} installation directory **mfserver\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/console**.
    * Select **appcenterconsole.war** and click **Next**.
    * On the **How do you want to install the application?** page, click **Detailed**, and then click **Next**.
    * On the **Application Security Warnings** page, click **Continue**.
    * Click **Next** until you reach the "Map context roots for web modules" page.
    * In the **Context Root** field, type **/appcenterconsole**.
    * Click **Next** until you reach the "Map security roles to users or groups" page.
    * Select all roles, click **Map Special Subjects** and select **All Authenticated in Application's Realm**.
    * Click **Next** until you reach the Summary page.
    * Click **Finish** and save the configuration.

5. Configure the class loader policies and then start the application:
    * Click **Applications → Application types → WebSphere Enterprise Applications**.
    * From the list of applications, click **AppCenterEAR**.
    * In the **Detail Properties** section, click the **Class loading and update detection** link.
    * In the **Class loader order** pane, click **Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)**.
    * Click **OK**.
    * In the **Modules section**, click **Manage Modules**.
    * From the list of modules, click **ApplicationCenterConsole**.
    * In the **Class loader order** pane, click **Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)**.
    * Click **OK**.
    * From the list of modules, click **ApplicationCenterServices**.
    * In the **Class loader order** pane, click **Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)**.
    * Click **OK** twice.
    * Click **Save**.
    * Select **appcenterconsoleEAR** and click **Start**.
6. Review the server class loader policy:

    Depending on your version of WebSphere Application Server, click **Servers → Server Types → Application Servers or Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers** and then select the server.
        * If the class loader policy is set to **Multiple**, do nothing.
        * If the class loader policy is set to **Single** and **Class loading mode** is set to **Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)**, do nothing.
        * If **Classloader policy** is set to **Single** and **Class loading mode** is set to **Classes loaded with parent class loader first**, set **Classloader policy** to **Multiple** and set the **classloader policy** of all applications other than MobileFirst applications to **Classes loaded with parent class loader first**.

7. Save the configuration.
8. Configure a JNDI environment entry to indicate the directory with binary files of the **aapt** program, from the Android SDK **platform-tools** package.
    * Determine a suitable directory for the aapt binary files in the WebSphere Application Server installation directory.
        * For a stand-alone server, you can use a directory such as **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/optionalLibraries/IBM/mobilefirst/android-sdk**.
        * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cell, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/mobilefirst/android-sdk**.
        * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cluster, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/clusters/cluster-name/mobilefirst/android-sdk**.
        * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment node, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/mobilefirst/android-sdk**.
        * For deployment to a WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment server, use **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name/config/cells/cell-name/nodes/node-name/servers/server-name/mobilefirst/android-sdk**.
    * Copy the **product\_install\_dir/ApplicationCenter/tools/android-sdk** directory to the directory that you determined in Substep a.
    * For WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, click **System administration → Nodes**, select the nodes, and click **Full Synchronize**.
    * Configure the environment entry (JNDI property) **android.aapt.dir** and set as its value the directory that you determined in Substep a. The **WAS\_INSTALL\_DIR/profiles/profile-name** profile is replaced with the WebSphere Application Server variable reference **${USER\_INSTALL\_ROOT}**.

    You can now access the Application Center at `http://<server>:<port>/appcenterconsole`, where server is the host name of your server and port is the port number (by default 9080).

## Configuring Application Center after installation
{: #configuring-application-center-after-installation }
After you install Application Center in the web application server that you designated, you have additional configuration to do.

### Configuring user authentication for Application Center
{: #configuring-user-authentication-for-application-center }
You configure user authentication and choose an authentication method. The configuration procedure depends on the web application server that you use. **Application Center requires user authentication**.

You must perform some configuration after the installer deploys Application Center web applications in the web application server.
Application Center has two Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) security roles defined:  

* The **appcenteruser** role that represents an ordinary user of Application Center who can install mobile applications from the catalog to a mobile device belonging to that user.
* The **appcenteradmin** role that represents a user who can perform administrative tasks through the Application Center console.

You must map the roles to the corresponding sets of users.

![Java EE security roles in Application Center](ac_jee_security_roles.jpg)

If you choose to use an authentication method through a user repository such as LDAP, you can configure Application Center so that you can use users and groups with the user repository to define the Access Control List (ACL) of Application Center. This procedure is conditioned by the type and version of the web application server that you use. See [Managing users with LDAP](#managing-users-with-ldap) for information about LDAP used with Application Center.

After you configure authentication of the users of Application Center, which includes configuring LDAP if you plan to use it, you can, if necessary, define the endpoint of the application resources. You must then build the Application Center mobile client. The mobile client is used to install applications on mobile devices. See [Preparations for using the mobile client](../../../appcenter/preparations/) for how to build the Application Center mobile client.

##### Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server full profile
{: #configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-full-profile }
Configure security by mapping the Application Center Java™ EE roles to a set of users for both web applications.

You define the basics of user configuration in the WebSphere  Application Server console. Access to the console is usually by this address: `https://localhost:9043/ibm/console/`.

1. Select **Security → Global Security**.
2. Select **Security Configuration Wizard** to configure users.  
    You can manage individual user accounts by selecting **Users and Groups → Manage Users**.

3. If you deployed WAR files, map the **appcenteruser** and **appcenteradmin** roles to a set of users as follows:
    * Select **Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers**.
    * Select the server.
    * In the Configuration tab, select **Applications → Enterprise applications**.

        ![Mapping the application center roles](ac_ws_full_maproles.jpg)
    * Select **IBM\_Application\_Center\_Services**.
    * In the Configuration tab, select **Details → Security role to user/group mapping**.
        ![Mapping the application center roles to user groups](ac_ws_full_usergrp.jpg)    
    * Perform the necessary customization.
    * Click **OK**.
    * Repeat the steps to map the roles for the console web application; select **IBM\_Application\_Center\_Console**.
    * Click **Save** to save the changes.

4. If you deployed an EAR file, map the appcenteruser and appcenteradmin roles to a set of users as follows:
    * Select **Applications → Application Types → WebSphere application servers**.
    * Click **AppCenterEAR**.
    * In the **Detail Properties** section, click **Security role to user/group mapping**.
    * Customize as necessary.
    * Click **OK**.
    * Click **Save**.    

##### Configuring the Java EE security roles on WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile
{: #configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-websphere-application-server-liberty-profile }
Configure the Java™ EE security roles of the Application Center and the data source in the **server.xml** file.

To configure the security roles, you must edit the **server.xml** file. In the `<application-bnd>` element of each `<application>` element, create two `<security-role>` elements. One `<security-role>` element is for the **appcenteruser** role and the other is for the **appcenteradmin** role. Map the roles to the appropriate user group name **appcenterusergroup** or **appcenteradmingroup**. These groups are defined through the `<basicRegistry>` element. You can customize this element or replace it entirely with an `<ldapRegistry>` element or a `<safRegistry>` element.

Then, to maintain good response times with a large number of installed applications, for example with 80 applications, you should configure a connection pool for the Application Center database.

1. Edit the **server.xml** file. For example:

   ```xml
   <security-role name="appcenteradmin">
      <group name="appcenteradmingroup"/>
   </security-role>
   <security-role name="appcenteruser">
      <group name="appcenterusergroup"/>
   </security-role>
   ```

   You must include this example in the following location:  

   * If you deployed WAR files, in the `<application-bnd>` element of each `<application>` element: the **appcenterconsole** and **applicationcenter** applications.
   * If you deployed an EAR file, in the `<application-bnd>` element of the **applicationcenter** application.

   Replace the `<security-role>` elements that have been created during installation for test purposes.

   ```xml
   <basicRegistry id="appcenter">
      <user name="admin" password="admin"/>
      <user name="guest" password="guest"/>
      <user name="demo" password="demo"/>
      <group name="appcenterusergroup">
        <member name="guest"/>
        <member name="demo"/>
      </group>
      <group name="appcenteradmingroup">
        <member name="admin" id="admin"/>
      </group>
   </basicRegistry>
   ```

   This example shows a definition of users and groups in the `basicRegistry` of WebSphere Application Server Liberty. For more information about configuring a user registry for WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, see [Configuring a user registry for the Liberty profile](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/twlp_sec_registries.html).

2. Edit the **server.xml** file to define the `AppCenterPool` size.

   ```xml
   <connectionManager id="AppCenterPool" minPoolSize="10" maxPoolSize="40"/>
   ```

3. In the `<dataSource>` element, define a reference to the connection manager:

   ```xml
   <dataSource id="APPCNTR" jndiName="jdbc/AppCenterDS" connectionManagerRef="AppCenterPool">
   ...
   </dataSource>
   ```

##### Configuring the Java EE security roles on Apache Tomcat
{: #configuring-the-java-ee-security-roles-on-apache-tomcat }
You must configure the Java™ EE security roles for the Application Center on the Apache Tomcat web application server.

1. In the Apache Tomcat web application server, you configure the roles of **appcenteruser** and **appcenteradmin** in the **conf/tomcat-users.xml** file. The installation creates the following users:

   ```xml
   <user username="appcenteradmin" password="admin" roles="appcenteradmin"/>
   <user username="demo" password="demo" roles="appcenteradmin"/>
   <user username="guest" password="guest" roles="appcenteradmin"/>
   ```

2. You can define the set of users as described in the Apache Tomcat documentation, [Realm Configuration HOW-TO](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html).

### Managing users with LDAP
{: #managing-users-with-ldap }
Use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) registry to manage users.

LDAP is a way to centralize the user management for multiple web applications in an LDAP Server that maintains a user registry. It can be used instead of specifying one by one the users for the security roles **appcenteradmin** and **appcenteruser**.

If you plan to use an LDAP registry with the Application Center, you must configure your WebSphere  Application Server or your Apache Tomcat server to use an LDAP registry to authenticate users.

In addition to authentication of users, configuring the Application Center for LDAP also enables you to use LDAP to define the users and groups who can install mobile applications through the Application Center. The means of defining these users and groups is the Access Control List (ACL).

Since IBM  Worklight  V6.0, use the JNDI environment entries for defining LDAP configuration properties.

Expert users could configure the application servers to use LDAP authentication by using the methods that were documented in releases before IBM Worklight V6.0.

* [LDAP with Apache Tomcat](#ldap-with-apache-tomcat)

##### LDAP with WebSphere Application Server V8.x
{: #ldap-with-websphere-application-server-v8x }
LDAP authentication is based on the federated repository configuration. ACL management configuration of the Application Center uses the Virtual Member Manager API.

You must configure LDAP based on the federated repository configuration. The stand-alone LDAP registry is not supported.

Several different repositories, LDAP and non-LDAP, can be configured in the federated repository.

For information about configuring federated repositories, see the [WebSphere  Application Server V8.0](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#/SSEQTP_8.0.0/as_ditamaps/welcome_base.html) user documentation or the [WebSphere Application Server V8.5](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/as_ditamaps/was855_welcome_base_dist_iseries.html) user documentation, depending on your version.

##### Configuration of the Application Center for ACL management with LDAP
{: #configuration-of-the-application-center-for-acl-management-with-ldap }
Some configuration details of ACL management are specific to the Application Center, because it uses the Virtual Member Manager (VMM) API.

The Application Center refers to these VMM attributes for users:

* **uid** represents the user login name.
* **sn** represents the full name of the user.
* For groups, the Application Center refers only to the VMM attribute **cn**.

If VMM attributes are not identical in LDAP, you must map the VMM attributes to the corresponding LDAP attributes.

##### Configuring LDAP authentication for WebSphere Application Server V8.x
{: #configuring-ldap-authentication-for-websphere-application-server-v8x }
You can configure LDAP based on the federated repository configuration only. This procedure shows you how to use LDAP to define the roles appcenteradmin and appcenteruser in WebSphere  Application Server V8.x.

1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server console.
2. Select **Security → Global security** and verify that administrative security and application security are enabled.
3. In the "User account repository" section, select **Federated repositories**.
4. Click **Configure**.
5. Add a repository and configure it.
    * Click **Add Base entry to Realm**.
    * Specify the value of **Distinguished name of a base entry that uniquely identifies entries in the realm** and click **Add Repository**.
    * Select **LDAP Repository**.
    * Give this repository a name and enter the values that are required to connect to your LDAP server.
    * Under **Additional Properties**, click **LDAP entity types**.
    * Configure the **Group**, **OrgContainer**, and **PersonAccount** properties. These configuration details depend on your LDAP server.
6. Save the configuration, log out, and restart the server.
7. If you deployed WAR files, in the WebSphere Application Server console, map the security roles to users and groups.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, select **Applications → WebSphere Enterprise applications**.
    * Select **IBM_Application_Center_Services**.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, select **Details → Security role to user/group mapping**.
    * For **appcenteradmin** and **appcenteruser** roles, select **Map groups**. This selection enables you to select users and groups inside the WebSphere user repository, including LDAP users and groups. The selected users can access the Application Center as **appcenteradmin** or **appcenteruser**. You can also map the roles to **Special Subjects** “All authenticated in application realm” to give everyone in the WebSphere user repository, including everyone registered in the LDAP registry, access to the Application Center.
8. Repeat step 7 for **IBM_Application_Center_Console**.

    Make sure that you select **IBM_Application_Center_Console** in step 7.b instead of **IBM_Application_Center_Services**.

9. If you deployed an EAR file, in the WebSphere Application Server console, map the security roles to users and groups.
    * Click **Applications → Application Types → WebSphere enterprise applications**.
    * From the list of applications, click **AppCenterEAR**.
    * In the **Detail Properties** section, click **Security role to user/group mapping**.
    * For **appcenteradmin** and **appcenteruser** roles, select **Map groups** or **Map users** to select users or groups inside the WebSphere user repository, including LDAP users and groups.

    The selected users can access the Application Center as **appcenteradmin** or **appcenteruser**. You can also map the roles to **Special Subjects** “All authenticated in application realm” to give access to the Application Center to everyone in the WebSphere user repository, including everyone registered in the LDAP registry.

10. Click **Save** to save your changes.

##### Configuring LDAP ACL management for WebSphere Application Server V8.x
{: #configuring-ldap-acl-management-for-websphere-application-server-v8x }
To configure ACL with LDAP, you define three properties: **uid**, **sn**, and **cn**. These properties enable the login name and the full name of users and the name of user groups to be identified in the Application Center. Then you enable ACL management with VMM. You can configure LDAP based on the federated repository configuration only.

1. Log in to the WebSphere  Application Server console.
2. Select **Security → Global security**.
3. In the **User account repository** section, select **Configure**.
4. Select your LDAP repository entry.
5. Under **Additional Properties**, select **LDAP attributes** (WebSphere Application Server V8.0) or **Federated repositories property names to LDAP attributes mapping** (WebSphere Application Server V8.5).
6. Select **Add → Supported**.
7. Enter these property values:
    * For **Name** enter your LDAP login attribute.
    * For **Property** name enter **uid**.
    * For **Entity types** enter the LDAP entity type.
    * Click **OK**.

    ![Associating LDAP login with uid property](ac_ldap__mail_w8.jpg)

8. Select **Add → Supported**.
    * For **Name** enter your LDAP attribute for full user name.
    * For **Property** name enter **sn**.
    * For **Entity types** enter the LDAP entity type.
    * Click **OK**.

    ![Associating LDAP full user name and password with sn property](ac_ldap_sn.jpg)

9. Select **Add → Supported** to configure a group name:
    * For **Name** enter the LDAP attribute for your group name.
    * For **Property** name enter **cn**.
    * For **Entity types** enter the LDAP entity type.
    * Click **OK**.

10. Enable ACL management with LDAP:
    * Select **Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers**.
    * Select the appropriate application server.  
        In a clustered environment you must configure all the servers in the cluster in the same way.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, under **Server Infrastructure**, click the **Java and Process Management** tab and select **Process definition**.
    * In the **Configuration** tab, under **Additional Properties**, select **Java Virtual Machine**,
    * In the **Configuration** tab, under **Additional Properties**, select **Custom properties**.
    * Enter the required property-value pairs in the form. To enter each pair, click **New**, enter the property and its value, and click **OK**.  
        Property-value pairs:
        * ibm.appcenter.ldap.vmm.active = true
        * ibm.appcenter.ldap.active = true
        * ibm.appcenter.ldap.cache.expiration.seconds = delay_in_seconds
    * Enter the delay in seconds before the LDAP cache expires. If you do not enter a value, the default value is 86400, which is equal to 24 hours.

    Changes to users and groups on the LDAP server become visible to the Application Center after a delay, which is specified by **ibm.appcenter.ldap.cache.expiration.seconds**. The Application Center maintains a cache of LDAP data and the changes become visible only after the cache expires. By default, the delay is 24 hours. If you do not want to wait for this delay to expire after changes to users or groups, you can call this command to clear the cache of LDAP data:

    ```xml
    acdeploytool.sh -clearLdapCache -s serverurl -c context -u user -p password
    ```

    See [Using the stand-alone tool to clear the LDAP cache](../../../appcenter/command-line/#using-the-stand-alone-tool-to-clear-the-ldap-cache) for details.

The following figure shows an example of custom properties with the correct settings.

![ACL management for Application Center with LDAP on WebSphere Application server v8](ac_ldap_props_w8.jpg)

**What to do next**  

1. Save the configuration and restart the server.
2. To use the VMM API, you must assign the **IdMgrReader** role to the users who run the VMM code, or to the group owners of these users. You must assign this role to all users and groups who have the **appcenteruser** or **appcenteradminroles**.
3. In the **was\_home\bin** directory, where **was_home** is the home directory of your WebSphere Application Server, run the **wsadmin** command.
4. After connecting with the WebSphere Application Server administrative user, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $AdminTask mapIdMgrGroupToRole {-roleName IdMgrReader -groupId your_LDAP_group_id}
    ```

5. Run the same command for all the groups mapped to the **appcenteruser** and **appcenteradminroles**. For individual users who are not members of groups, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $AdminTask mapIdMgrUserToRole {-roleName IdMgrReader -userId your_LDAP_user_id}
    ```

    You can assign the special subject "All Authenticated in Application's Realm" as roles for appcenteruser and appcenteradmin. If you choose to assign this special subject, IdMgrReader must be configured in the following way:

    ```bash
    $AdminTask mapIdMgrGroupToRole {-roleName IdMgrReader -groupId ALLAUTHENTICATED}
    ```

6. Enter **exit** to end **wsadmin**.

##### LDAP with Liberty profile
{: #ldap-with-liberty-profile }
Use LDAP to authenticate users and to define the users and groups who can install mobile applications with the Application Center by using the JNDI environment.

Using LDAP with Liberty profile requires you to configure LDAP authentication and LDAP ACL management.

* [Configuring LDAP authentication for the Liberty profile](#configuring-ldap-authentication-for-the-liberty-profile)
* [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile)

##### Configuring LDAP authentication for the Liberty profile
{: #configuring-ldap-authentication-for-the-liberty-profile }
You can configure LDAP authentication of users and groups in the **server.xml** file by defining an LDAP registry or, since WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile V8.5.5, a federated registry that uses several LDAP registries. Then, you map users and groups to Application Center roles. The mapping configuration is the same for LDAP authentication and basic authentication.

1. To open the **server.xml** descriptor file, enter **{server.config.dir}/server.xml**
2. Insert one or several LDAP registry definitions after the `<httpEndpoint>` element. Example for the LDAP registry:

   ```xml
   <ldapRegistry baseDN="o=ibm.com" host="employees.com" id="Employees"
                  ldapType="IBM Tivoli Directory Server" port="389" realm="AppCenterLdap"
                  recursiveSearch="true">
      <idsFilters
          groupFilter="(&amp;(cn=%v)(|(objectclass=groupOfNames)(objectclass=groupOfUniqueNames))) " id="Employees"
          userFilter="(&amp;(emailAddress=%v)(objectclass=ibmPerson))"
          groupMemberIdMap="ibm-allGroups:member;ibm-allGroups:uniqueMember"
          userIdMap="*:emailAddress"/>
   </ldapRegistry>
   ```

   For information about the parameters that are used in this example, see the [WebSphere Application Server V8.5](http://ibm.biz/knowctr#SSEQTP_8.5.5/as_ditamaps/was855_welcome_base_dist_iseries.html) user documentation.

3. Insert a security role definition after each Application Center application definition.

   * If you deployed WAR files: **applicationcenter** and **appcenterconsole**
   * If you deployed an EAR file: **applicationcenter**

   **Group names unique within LDAP**  
   This sample code shows how to use the group names **ldapGroupForAppcenteruser** and **ldapGroupForAppcenteradmin** when they exist and are unique within LDAP.

   ```xml
   <application-bnd>
         <security-role name="appcenteruser" id="appcenteruser">
           <group name="ldapGroupForAppcenteruser" />
         </security-role>
         <security-role name="appcenteradmin" id="appcenteradmin">
           <group name="ldapGroupForAppcenteradmin" />
         </security-role>
   </application-bnd>
   ```

   **Group names not unique within LDAP**  
   This sample code shows how to code the mapping when the group names are not unique within LDAP. The groups must be specified with the **access-id** attribute. The **access-id** attribute must refer to the realm name that is used to specify the LDAP realm. In this sample code, the realm name is **AppCenterLdap**. The remainder of the **access-id** attribute specifies one of the LDAP groups named **ldapGroup** in a way that makes it unique.

   ```xml
   <application-bnd>
         <security-role name="appcenteruser" id="appcenteruser">
           <group name="ldapGroup"
                  id="ldapGroup"
                  access-id="group:AppCenterLdap/CN=ldapGroup,OU=myorg,
                             DC=mydomain,DC=AD,DC=myco,DC=com"/>
         </security-role>
         ...
   </application-bnd>
   ```

   If applicable, use similar code to map the **appcenteradmin** role.

##### Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)
{: #configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile }
You enable ACL management after you configure LDAP and map users and groups to Application Center roles. Only the simple type of LDAP authentication is supported.

To be able to define JNDI entries, the following feature must be defined in the **server.xml** file:

```xml
<feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
```

Add an entry for each property in the `<server>` section of the **server.xml** file. This entry should have the following syntax:

```xml
<jndiEntry jndiName="JNDI_property_name" value="property_value"/>
```

Where:

* **JNDI\_property\_name** is the name of the property you are adding.
* **property\_value** is the value of the property you are adding.

#### LDAP with Apache Tomcat
{: #ldap-with-apache-tomcat }
Configure the Apache Tomcat application server for LDAP authentication and configure security (Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition) in the web.xml file of the Application Center.

To configure ACL management of the Application Center, configure LDAP for user authentication, map the Java™ EE roles of the Application Center to the LDAP roles, and configure the Application Center properties for LDAP authentication. Only the simple type of LDAP authentication is supported.

* [Configuration of LDAP authentication (Apache Tomcat)](#configuration-of-ldap-authentication-apache-tomcat)
* [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat)

##### Configuration of LDAP authentication (Apache Tomcat)
{: #configuration-of-ldap-authentication-apache-tomcat }
Define the users who can access the Application Center console and the users who can log in with the mobile client by mapping Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition roles to LDAP roles.

To configure ACL management of the Application Center, follow this process:

* Configure LDAP for user authentication.
* Map the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) roles of the Application Center to the LDAP roles.
* Configure theApplication Center properties for LDAP authentication.

**Restriction:** Only the simple type of LDAP authentication is supported.

You configure the Apache Tomcat server for LDAP authentication and configure security (Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition) in the web.xml file of theApplication Center Services web application (**applicationcenter.war**) and of the Application Center Console web application (**appcenterconsole.war**).

**LDAP user authentication**  
You must configure a **JNDIRealm** in the **server.xml** file in the `<Host>` element. For more information about configuring a realm, see the Realm Component on the Apache Tomcat website.

**Example of configuration on Apache Tomcat to authenticate against an LDAP server**  
This example shows how to configure user authentication on an Apache Tomcat server by comparing with the authorization of these users on a server enabled for LDAP authentication.

```xml
<Host appBase="webapps" autoDeploy="true" name="localhost" unpackWARs="true">
 ...
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm"
       connectionURL="ldap://bluepages.ibm.com:389"
       userSubtree="true"
       userBase="ou=bluepages,o=ibm.com"
       userSearch="(emailAddress={0})"
       roleBase="ou=ibmgroups,o=ibm.com"
       roleName="cn"
       roleSubtree="true"
       roleSearch="(uniqueMember={0})"
       allRolesMode="authOnly"
       commonRole="appcenter"/>
 ...
</Host>
```

The value of **connectionURL** is the LDAP URL of your LDAP server.

The **userSubtree**, **userBase**, and **userSearch** attributes define how to use the name that is given to the Application Center in login form (in the browser message box) to match an LDAP user entry.

In the example, the definition of **userSearch** specifies that the user name is used to match the email address of an LDAP user entry.

The basis or scope of the search is defined by the value of the **userBase** attribute. In LDAP, an information tree is defined; the user base indicates a node in that tree.

Set the value of **userSubtree** to true; if it is set to **false**, the search runs only on the direct child nodes of the user base. It is important that the search penetrates the subtree and does not stop at the first level.

For authentication, you define only the **userSubtree**, **userBase**, and **userSearch** attributes. The Application Center also uses Java EE security roles. Therefore, you must map LDAP attributes to some Java EE roles. These attributes are used for mapping LDAP attributes to security roles:

* **roleBase**
* **roleName**
* **roleSubtree**
* **roleSearch**

In this example, the value of the **roleSearch** attribute matches all LDAP entries with a **uniqueMember** attribute whose value is the **Distinguished Name (DN)** of the authenticated user.

* The **roleBase** attribute specifies a node in the LDAP tree below which the roles are defined.
* The **roleSubtree** attribute indicates whether the LDAP search should search the entire subtree, whose root is defined by the value of **roleBase**, or only the direct child nodes.
* The **roleName** attribute defines the name of the LDAP attribute.
* The **allRolesMode** attribute specifies that you can use the asterisk (\*) character as the value of **role-name** in the
**web.xml** file. This attribute is optional.
* The **commonRole** attribute adds a role that is shared by all authenticated users. This attribute is optional.

**Mapping the Java EE roles of the Application Center to LDAP roles**  
After you define the LDAP request for the Java EE roles, you must change the **web.xml** file of the Application Center Services web application (**applicationcenter.war**) and of the Application Center Console web application (**appcenterconsole.war**) to map the Java EE roles of **appcenteradmin** and **appcenteruser** to the LDAP roles.

These examples, where LDAP users have LDAP roles, called **MyLdapAdmin** and **MyLdapUser**, show where and how to change the web.xml file. Replace the names **MyLdapAdmin** and **MyLdapUser** with the roles that are defined in your LDAP. Modify the following files:

* **tomcat\_install\_dir/webapps/appcenterconsole/WEB-INF/web.xml**
* **tomcat\_install\_dir/webapps/applicationcenter/WEB-INF/web.xml**

**The security-role-ref element in the JAX_RS servlet**  

```xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>...</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>...</servlet-class>
        <init-param>
            ...		
        </init-param>
       <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
       <security-role-ref>
           <role-name>appcenteradmin</role-name>
           <role-link>MyLdapAdmin</role-link>
       </security-role-ref>
       <security-role-ref>
           <role-name>appcenteruser</role-name>
           <role-link>MyLdapUser</role-link>
       </security-role-ref>
</servlet>
```

**The security-role element**  

```xml
<security-role>
    <role-name>MyLdapAdmin</role-name>
</security-role>
<security-role>
    <role-name>MyLdapUser</role-name>
</security-role>
```

**The auth-constraint element**  
After you edit the **security-role-ref** and the **security-role** elements, you can use the roles that are defined in the **auth-constraint** elements to protect the web resources. Edit these roles for the **appcenteradminConstraint** element in both the **web.xml** file of both **appcenterconsole** and **applicationcenter**, and for the **appcenteruserConstraint** element in the **appcenterconsole** **web.xml** file.

```xml
<security-constraint>
        <display-name>appcenteradminConstraint</display-name>
        <web-resource-collection>
            ...
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>MyLdapAdmin</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
        <user-data-constraint>
            ...
        </user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
```

and

```xml
<security-constraint>
        <display-name>appcenteruserConstraint</display-name>
        <web-resource-collection>
            ...
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>MyLdapUser</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
        <user-data-constraint>
            ...
        </user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
```

#### Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)
{: #configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat }
Use LDAP to define the users and groups who can install mobile applications with the Application Center by defining the Application Center LDAP properties through JNDI.

To configure LDAP ACL management of the Application Center; add an entry for each property in the `<context>` section of the IBM  Application Center Services application in the server.xml file. This entry should have the following syntax:

```xml
<Environment name="JNDI_property_name" value="property_value" type="java.lang.String" override="false"/>

### Configuring properties of DB2 JDBC driver in WebSphere Application Server
{: #configuring-properties-of-db2-jdbc-driver-in-websphere-application-server }
Add some JDBC custom properties to avoid DB2  exceptions from a WebSphere  Application Server that uses the IBM  DB2 database.

When you use WebSphere Application Server with an IBM DB2 database, this exception could occur:

```bash
Invalid operation: result set is closed. ERRORCODE=-4470, SQLSTATE=null
```

To avoid such exceptions, you must add custom properties in WebSphere Application Server at the Application Center data source level.

1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server administration console.
2. Select **Resources → JDBC → Data sources → Application Center DataSource name → Custom properties** and click **New**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter **allowNextOnExhaustedResultSet**.
4. In the **Value** field, type **1**.
5. Change the type to **java.lang.Integer**.
6. Click **OK**.
7. Click **New**.
8. In the **Name** field, enter **resultSetHoldability**.
9. In the **Value** field, type **1**.
10. Change the type to **java.lang.Integer**.
11. Click **OK** and save your changes.

### Managing the DB2 transaction log size
{: #managing-the-db2-transaction-log-size }
When you upload an application that is at least 40 MB with IBM MobileFirst Foundation Application Center console, you might receive a transaction log full error.

The following system output is an example of the **transaction log full** error code.

```bash
DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-964, SQLSTATE=57011
```

The content of each application is stored in the Application Center database.

The active log files are defined in number by the **LOGPRIMARY** and **LOGSECOND** database configuration parameters, and in size by the LOGFILSIZ database configuration parameter. A single transaction cannot use more log space than **LOGFILSZ * (LOGPRIMARY + LOGSECOND) * 4096 KB**.

The `DB2 GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION` command includes information about the log file size, and the number of primary and secondary log files.

Depending on the largest size of the MobileFirst application that is deployed, you might need to increase the DB2  log space.

Using the `DB2 update db cfg` command, increase the **LOGSECOND** parameter. Space is not allocated when the database is activated. Instead, the space is allocated only as needed.

### Defining the endpoint of the application resources
{: #defining-the-endpoint-of-the-application-resources }
When you add a mobile application from the Application Center console, the server-side component creates Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) for the application resources (package and icons). The mobile client uses these URI to manage the applications on your device.

To manage the applications on your device, the Application Center console must be able to locate the Application Center REST services and to generate the required number of URI that enable the mobile client to find the Application Center REST services.

By default, the URI protocol, host name, and port are the same as those defined in the web application server used to access the Application Center console; the context root of the Application Center REST services is **applicationcenter**. When the context root of the Application Center REST services is changed or when the internal URI of the web application server is different from the external URI that can be used by the mobile client, the externally accessible endpoint (protocol, host name, and port) of the application resources must be defined by configuring the web application server. (Reasons for separating internal and external URI could be, for example, a firewall or a secured reverse proxy that uses HTTP redirection.)

The following figure shows a configuration with a secured reverse proxy that hides the internal address (192.168...). The mobile client must use the external address (**appcntr.net**).

![Configuration with secured reverse proxy](ac_proxyconfig_hiddenintadd.jpg)

#### Endpoint properties
{: #endpoint-properties }

| Property name | Purpose | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| ibm.appcenter.services.endpoint | This property enables the Application Center console to locate the Application Center REST services. The value of this property must be specified as the external address and context root of the applicationcenter.war web application. You can use the asterisk (\*) character as wildcard to specify that the Application Center REST services use the same value as the Application Center console. For example: *://*:*/appcenter means use the same protocol, host, and port as the Application Center console, but use appcenter as context root. This property must be specified for the Application Center console application. | https://appcntr.net:443/applicationcenter |
| ibm.appcenter.proxy.protocol | This property specifies the protocol required for external applications to connect to the Application Center. | https |
| ibm.appcenter.proxy.host | This property specifies the host name required for external applications to connect to the Application Center. | appcntr.net |
| ibm.appcenter.proxy.port | This property specifies the port required for external applications to connect to the Application Center. | 443 |

```

### Configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
{: #configuring-secure-sockets-layer-ssl }
Learn about configuring SSL for the Application Center on supported application servers and the limitations of certificate verification on mobile operating systems.

You can configure the Application Center with SSL or without SSL, **unless** you intend to install applications on iOS devices. For iOS applications, you must configure the Application Center server with SSL.

SSL transmits data over the network in a secured channel. You must purchase an official SSL certificate from an SSL certificate authority. The SSL certificate must be compatible with Android and iOS. Self-signed certificates do not work with the Application Center.

When the client accesses the server through SSL, the client verifies the server through the SSL certificate. If the server address matches the address that is filed in the SSL certificate, the client accepts the connection. For the verification to be successful, the client must know the root certificate of the certificate authority. Many root certificates are preinstalled on Android and iOS devices. The exact list of pre-installed root certificates varies between versions of mobile operating systems.

For information about the certificates supported on mobile operating system versions, consult the SSL certificate authority.

If the SSL certificate verification fails, a normal web browser requests confirmation to contact an untrusted site. The same behavior occurs when you use a self-signed certificate that was not purchased from a certificate authority. When mobile applications are installed, this control is not performed by a normal web browser, but by operating system calls.

Some versions of Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems do not support this confirmation dialog in system calls. This limitation is a reason to avoid self-signed certificates or SSL certificates that are not suited to mobile operating systems. On Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems, you can install a self-signed CA certificate on the device to enable the device to handle system calls regarding this self-signed certificate. This practice is not appropriate for Application Center in a production environment, but it can be suitable during the testing period. For details, see [Managing and installing self-signed CA certificates in an Application Center test environment](#managing-and-installing-self-signed-ca-certificates-in-an-application-center-test-environment) below.

##### Configuring SSL for WebSphere Application Server full profile
{: #configuring-ssl-for-websphere-application-server-full-profile }
Request a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and process the received documents to import them into the keystore.  
This procedure indicates how to request an SSL certificate and import it and the chain certificate into your keystore.

1. Create a request to a certificate authority; in the WebSphere  administrative console, select **Security → SSL certificate and key management → Key stores and certificates → keystore → Personal certificate requests → New**, where **keystore** identifies your keystore.

    The request is sent to the certificate authority.

2. When you receive the SSL certificate, import it and the corresponding chain certificate into your keystore by following the instructions provided by the certificate authority. In the WebSphere administrative console, you can find the corresponding option in **Security → SSL certificate and key management → Manage endpoint security configurations → node SSL settings → Key stores and certificates → keystore → Personal certificates → certificate → Receive a certificate from a certificate authority**.

    Where:  
    * **node SSL settings** shows the SSL settings of the nodes in your configuration.
    * **keystore** identifies your keystore.
    * **certificate** identifies the certificate that you received.

3. Create an SSL configuration. See the instructions in the user documentation that corresponds to the version of the WebSphere Application Server full profile that supports your applications.

You can find configuration details in the WebSphere administrative console at **Security → SSL certificate and key management → Manage endpoint security configurations → SSL Configurations**.

##### Configuring SSL for Liberty profile
{: #configuring-ssl-for-liberty-profile }
Create a keystore, import the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate, and edit the server.xml file to configure SSL on Liberty profile.  
Follow the steps in this procedure to configure SSL on Liberty profile.

1. Create a keystore for your web server; use the **securityUtility** with the **createSSLCertificate** option. See [Enabling SSL communication for the Liberty profile](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.doc/ae/twlp_sec_ssl.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5%2F1-3-11-0-4-1-0) for more information.
2. Import the SSL certificate and the corresponding chain certificate into your keystore by following the instructions provided by the certificate authority.
3. Enable the ssl-1.0 Liberty feature in the **server.xml** file.

   ```xml
   <featureManager>
      <feature>ssl-1.0</feature>
   </featureManager>
   ```

4. Add the keystore service object entry to the server.xml file. The **keyStore** element is called **defaultKeyStore** and contains the keystore password. For example:

   ```xml
   <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" location="/path/to/myKeyStore.p12"
          password="myPassword" type="PKCS12"/>
   ```

5. Make sure that the value of the **httpEndpoint** element in the **server.xml** file defines the httpsPort attribute. For example:

   ```xml
   <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint” host="*" httpPort="9080” httpsPort="9443" >
   ```

6. Restart the web server. Now you can access the web server by `https://myserver:9443/...`

##### Configuring SSL for Apache Tomcat
{: #configuring-ssl-for-apache-tomcat }
Create a keystore, import the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate, and edit the **conf/server.xml** file to define a connector for SSL on Apache Tomcat.
Follow the steps in this procedure to configure SSL on Apache Tomcat. See [SSL Configuration HOW-TO](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html) for more details and examples of configuring SSL for Apache Tomcat.

1. Create a keystore for your web server. You can use the Java™ **keytool** command to create a keystore.

   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/keystore.jks
   ```

2. Import the SSL certificate and the corresponding chain certificate into your keystore by following the instructions provided by the certificate authority.
3. Edit the **conf/server.xml** file to define a connector to use SSL. This connector must point to your keystore.

   ```xml
   <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
               keystoreFile="/path/to/keystore.jks"
               keystorePass="mypassword" />
   ```

4. Restart the web server. Now you can access the web server by `https://myserver:8443/...`

##### Managing and installing self-signed CA certificates in an Application Center test environment
{: #managing-and-installing-self-signed-ca-certificates-in-an-application-center-test-environment }
Use self-signed certificate authority (CA) certificates in test environments to install applications with Application Center on a mobile device from a secured server.

**Uploading or deleting a certificate**  
When you install the Application Center mobile client from OTA (the bootstrap page), the device user must upload and install the self-signed CA file before the Application Center mobile client is installed.

When you use Application Center for a test installation, the administrator might not have a real Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate available. You might want to use a self-signed CA certificate. Such certificates work if they get installed on the device as root certificate.
As an administrator, you can easily distribute self-signed CA certificates to devices.

The following procedure focuses mostly on the iOS and Android environments. Support for X.509 certificates comes from the individual mobile platforms, not from IBM MobileFirst Foundation. For more information about specific requirements for X.509 certificates, see the documentation of each mobile platform.

Managing self-signed certificates: in your role of administrator of Application Center, you can access the list of registered self-signed CA certificates to upload or delete certificates.

1. To display Application Center settings, click the gear icon Icon to access Application Center settings.
2. To display the list of registered certificates, select **Self Signed Certificates**.
3. Upload or delete a certificate.
    * To upload a self-signed CA certificate, in the Application Center console, click **Upload a certificate** and select a certificate file.

    **Note:** The certificate file must be in PEM file format. Typical file name suffixes for this type of file are **.pem, .key, .cer, .cert**. The certificate must be a self-signed one, that is, the values of the **Issuer** and **Subject** fields must be the same. And the certificate must be a CA certificate, that is, it must have the X509 extension named **BasicConstraint** set to **CA:TRUE**.

* To delete a certificate, click the trash can icon on the right of the certificate file name in the list.

**Installing a self-signed CA certificate on a device**  
Registered self-signed CA certificates are available through the bootstrap page at `http://hostname:portnumber/appcenterconsole/installers.html`.

Where:

* **hostname** is the name of the server that hosts the Application Center console.
* **portnumber** is the corresponding port number.

1. Click the **SSL Certificates** tab.
2. To display the details of a certificate, select the appropriate registered certificate.
3. To download and install the certificate on the device, click **Install**.

### JNDI properties for Application Center
{: #jndi-properties-for-application-center }
You can configure some JNDI properties for Application Center.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| appcenter.database.type | The database type, which is required only when the database is not specified in appcenter.jndi.name. |
| appcenter.jndi.name | The JNDI name of the database. This parameter is the normal mechanism to specify the database. The default value is java:comp/env/jdbc/AppCenterDS. |
| appcenter.openjpa.ConnectionDriverName | The fully qualified class name of the database connection driver class. This property is needed only when the database is not specified in appcenter.jndi.name. |
| appcenter.openjpa.ConnectionPassword | The password for the database connection. Set this property only when the database is not specified in appcenter.jndi.name. |
| appcenter.openjpa.ConnectionURL | The URL for the database connection driver class. Set this property only when the database is not specified in appcenter.jndi.name. |
| appcenter.openjpa.ConnectionUserName | The user name for the database connection. Set this property only when the database is not specified in appcenter.jndi.name. |
| ibm.appcenter.apns.p12.certificate.isDevelopmentCertificate | Set this property to true to specify whether the certificate that enables Application Center to send push notifications about updates of iOS applications is a development certificate. Set the property to **false** if it is not a development certificate. See [Configuring the Application Center server for connection to Apple Push Notification Services](../../../appcenter/push-notifications/#apns). |
| ibm.appcenter.apns.p12.certificate.location | The path to the file of the development certificate that enables Application Center to send push notifications about updates of iOS applications. For example, **/Users/someUser/someDirectory/apache-tomcat/conf/AppCenter_apns_dev_cert.p12**. See [Configuring the Application Center server for connection to Apple Push Notification Services](../../../appcenter/push-notifications/#apns). |
| ibm.appcenter.apns.p12.certificate.password | The password of the certificate that enables Application Center to send push notifications about updates of iOS applications. See [Configuring the Application Center server for connection to Apple Push Notification Services](../../../appcenter/push-notifications/#apns). |
| ibm.appcenter.forceUpgradeDBTo60 | The database design was changed starting from IBM  Worklight  version 6.0. The database is automatically updated when the Application Center web application starts. If you want to repeat this update, you can set this parameter to **true** and start the web application again. Later you can reset this parameter to **false**. |
| ibm.appcenter.gcm.signature.googleapikey | The Google API key that enables Application Center to send push notifications about updates for Android applications. For example, AIxaScCHg0VSGdgfOZKtzDJ44-oi0muUasMZvAs. See [Configuring the Application Center server for connection to Google Cloud Messaging](../../../appcenter/push-notifications/#gcm). |
| ibm.appcenter.ios.plist.onetimeur | Specifies whether URLs stored in iOS plist manifests use the one-time URL mechanism without credentials. If you set this property to true, the security level is medium, because one-time URLs are generated with a cryptographic mechanism so that nobody can guess the URL but do not require the user to log in. Setting this property to false provides maximal security, because the user is then required to log in for each URL. However, requesting the user to log in multiple times when you install an iOS application can degrade the user experience. See [Installing the client on an iOS mobile device](../../../appcenter/mobile-client/#installing-the-client-on-an-ios-mobile-device). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.active | Specifies whether Application Center is configured for LDAP. Set this property to true to enable LDAP or to false to disable LDAP. See [Managing users with LDAP](#managing-users-with-ldap). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.cache.expiration.seconds | The Application Center maintains a cache of LDAP data and the changes become visible only after the cache expires. Specify the number of seconds during which an entry in the LDAP cache is valid. Set this property to a value greater than 3600 (1 hour) to reduce the amount of LDAP requests. If no value is entered, the default value is 86400, which is equal to 24 hours. If you need to clear the cache of LDAP data manually, enter this command: `acdeploytool.sh -clearLdapCache -s serverurl -c context -u user -p password`. See [Using the stand-alone tool to clear the LDAP cache](../../../appcenter/command-line/#using-the-stand-alone-tool-to-clear-the-ldap-cache). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.connectionURL | The URL to access the LDAP server when no Virtual Member Manager (VMM) is used. See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile) and [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.federated.active | Specifies whether Application Center is configured for LDAP with federated repositories. Since WebSphere  Application Server Liberty profile V8.5.5., set this property to true to enable use of the federated registry. Set this property to false to disable use of the federated registry, which is the default setting. See [Managing users with LDAP](#managing-users-with-ldap). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.base | The search base to find groups when you use LDAP without Virtual Member Manager (VMM). See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile) and [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.filter | LDAP group search filter. Use **%v** as the placeholder for the group attribute. This property is only required when LDAP users and groups are defined in the same subtree; that is, when the properties **ibm.appcenter.ldap.user.base** and **ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.base** have the same value. |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.name | The group name attribute when you use LDAP without Virtual Member Manager (VMM). See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile) and [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.nesting | Specifies whether the LDAP contains nested groups (that is, groups in groups) when you use LDAP without Virtual Member Manager (VMM). Setting this property to false speeds up LDAP access because the groups are not searched recursively. See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile) and [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.group.uniquemember | Specifies the members of a group when you use LDAP without Virtual Member Manager (VMM). This property is the inverse of ibm.appcenter.ldap.user.groupmembership. See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Liberty profile)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-liberty-profile) and [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.referral | Specifies whether referrals are supported by the JNDI API. If no value is specified, the JNDI API does not handle LDAP referrals. Here are the possible values:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>ignore: Ignores referrals that are found in the LDAP server.</li><li>follow: Automatically follows any referrals that are found in the LDAP server.</li><li>throw: Causes an exception to occur for each referral found in the LDAP server.</li></ul>{:/} |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.security.binddn | The distinguished name of the user that is allowed to search the LDAP directory. Use this property only if security binding is required. |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.security.bindpwd | The password of the user that is permitted to search the LDAP directory. Use this property only if security binding is required.<br><br>The password can be encoded with the Liberty profile securityUtility tool. Run the tool and then set the value of this property to the encoded password that is generated by the tool.<br><br>Edit the Liberty profile server.xml file to check whether the classloader is enabled to load the JAR file that decodes the password.<br><br>See [Configuring LDAP ACL management (Apache Tomcat)](#configuring-ldap-acl-management-apache-tomcat). |
| ibm.appcenter.ldap.security.sasl | Specifies the security authentication mechanism when the LDAP external SASL authentication mechanism is required to bind to the LDAP server. The value depends on the LDAP server and it is typically set to EXTERNAL. When this property is set, security authentication is required to connect to LDAP without Virtual Member Manager (VMM).

| ibm.appcenter.proxy.scheme | This property is just an alternative name for ibm.appcenter.proxy.protocol. |
| ibm.appcenter.push.schedule.period.amount | Specifies the time schedule when you send push notifications of application updates. When applications are frequently changed on the server, set this property to send batches of notifications. For example, send all notifications that happened within the past hour, instead of sending each individual notification. |
| ibm.appcenter.push.schedule.period.unit | Specifies the unit for the time schedule when you send push notifications of application updates. |
| ibm.appcenter.services.endpoint | Enables the Application Center console to locate the Application Center REST services. Specify the external address and context root of the applicationcenter.war web application. In a scenario with a firewall or a secured reverse proxy, this URI must be the external URI and not the internal URI inside the local LAN. For example, https://appcntr.net:443/applicationcenter. See [Defining the endpoint of the application resources](#defining-the-endpoint-of-the-application-resources). |
| ibm.appcenter.services.iconCacheMaxAge | Specifies the number of seconds during which cached icons remain valid for the Application Center console and the client. Application icons rarely change, therefore they are cached. Specify values larger than 600 (10 min) to reduce the amount of data transfer for the icons. |
| mfp.jndi.configuration | Optional. If the JNDI configuration is injected into the WAR files or provided as a shared library, the value of this property is the name of the JNDI configuration. You can also specify this value as a system property. |
| mfp.jndi.file | Optional. If the JNDI configuration is stored as an external file, the value of this property is the path of a file that describes the JNDI configuration. You can also specify this value as a system property. |

### Configuring WebSphere Application Server to support applications in public app stores
{: #configuring-websphere-application-server-to-support-applications-in-public-app-stores }
Configure WebSphere  Application Server full profile and Liberty profile before access to public app stores through application links, because of the use of SSL connections.

The constraint imposed by the use of SSL connections requires the root certificates of public app stores to exist in the WebSphere truststore before you can use application links to access these public stores. The configuration requirement applies to both WebSphere Application Server full profile and Liberty profile.

The root certificate of Google play must be imported into the WebSphere truststore before you can use application links to Google play.  
The root certificate of Apple iTunes must be imported into the WebSphere truststore before you can use application links to iTunes.

#### Configuring Liberty profile when IBM JDK is used
{: #configuring-liberty-profile-when-ibm-jdk-is-used }
Configure Liberty profile to use default JSSE socket factories instead of SSL socket factories of WebSphere  Application Server when IBM  JDK is used.

The purpose is to configure the IBM JDK SSL factories to be compatible with Liberty profile. This configuration is required only when IBM JDK is used. The configuration does not apply for use of Oracle JDK. By default, IBM JDK uses the SSL socket factories of WebSphere Application Server. These factories are not supported by Liberty profile.

##### Exception when WebSphere Application Server SSL socket factories are used
{: #exception-when-websphere-application-server-ssl-socket-factories-are-used }
If you use the IBM JDK of WebSphere Application Server, this exception could occur because this JDK uses SSL socket factories that are not supported by the Liberty profile. In this case, follow the requirements documented in [Troubleshooting tips](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/rwlp_trouble.html?view=kc).
