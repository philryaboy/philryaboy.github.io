## Overview
{: #overview }
For secure Direct Update to work, a user-defined keystore file must be deployed in {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} and a copy of the matching public key must be included in the deployed client application.

This topic describes how to bind a public key to new client applications and existing client applications that were upgraded. For more information on configuring the keystore in {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}, see [Configuring the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} keystore](../../../authentication-and-security/configuring-the-mobilefirst-server-keystore/).

The server provides a built-in keystore that can be used for testing secure Direct Update for development phases.

**Note:** After you bind the public key to the client application and rebuild it, you do not need to upload it again to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}. However, if you previously published the application to the market, without the public key, you must republish it.

For development purposes, the following default, dummy public key is provided with {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}:

```xml

> Important: Do not use the public key for production purposes.

## Generating and deploying the keystore
{: #generating-and-deploying-the-keystore }
There are many tools available for generating certificates and extracting public keys from a keystore. The following example demonstrates the procedures with the JDK keytool utility and openSSL.

1. Extract the public key from the keystore file that is deployed in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}.  
   Note: The public key must be Base64 encoded.
    
   For example, assume that the alias name is `mfp-server` and the keystore file is **keystore.jks**.  
   To generate a certificate, issue the following command:
    
   ```bash
   keytool -export -alias mfp-server -file certfile.cert
   -keystore keystore.jks -storepass keypassword
   ```
    
   A certificate file is generated.  
   Issue the following command to extract the public key:
    
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -inform der -in certfile.cert -pubkey -noout
   ```
    
   **Note:** Keytool alone cannot extract public keys in Base64 format.
    
2. Perform one of the following procedures:
    * Copy the resulting text, without the `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` and `END PUBLIC KEY` markers into the mfpclient property file of the application, immediately after `wlSecureDirectUpdatePublicKey`.
    * From the command prompt, issue the following command: `mfpdev app config direct_update_authenticity_public_key <public_key>`
    
    For `<public_key>`, paste the text that results from Step 1, without the `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` and `END PUBLIC KEY` markers.

3. Run the cordova build command to save the public key in the application.
