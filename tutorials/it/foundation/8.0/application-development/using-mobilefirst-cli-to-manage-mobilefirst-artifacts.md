## Overview
{: #overview }
{{ site.data.keys.product_full }} provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for the developer, **mfpdev**, to easily manage client and server artifacts.  
Using the CLI you can manage Cordova-based applications that uses the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Cordova plug-in, and Native applications that uses the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Native SDK.

You can also create, register, and manage adapters to either local or remote {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instances, and administer projects from the command line or via REST services, or from the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}.

The **mfpdev** commands have two modes: interactive mode and direct mode. In interactive mode, you enter the command without options, and you are prompted for responses. In direct mode, you enter the full command, including options, and prompts are not provided. When applicable, the prompts are context-sensitive to the target platform of the app, as determined by the directory from which you run the command. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to move through the selections, and press the Enter key when the selection you want is highlighted and preceded by a ">" character.

In this tutorial you will learn how to install the `mfpdev` Command Line Interface (CLI) and how to use it to manage {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instances, applications and adapters.

> For more information regarding SDK integration in Cordova and Native applications, see the tutorials in the [Adding the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK](../../application-development/sdk/) category.

## Prerequisites
{: #prerequisites }
The {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }} is available as an NPM package at the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).  

Ensure **node.js** and **npm** is installed in the development environment in order to install NPM packages.  
Follow the installation instructions in [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to install node.js.

To confirm that node.js is properly installed, run the command `node -v`.

```bash
node -v
v6.11.1
```

> **Note:** Minimum supported **node.js** version is **4.2.3**. Also, with the fast evolving **node** and **npm** packages, the MobileFirst CLI might not be fully functional with all the available versions of **node** and **npm** including the latest versions. Ensure that **node** is on version **6.11.1** and **npm** version is **3.10.10**, for proper functioning of the CLI.

## Installing the {{ site.data.keys.mf_cli }}
{: #installing-the-mobilefirst-cli }
To install the Command Line Interface run the command:

```bash
npm install -g mfpdev-cli
```

If the CLI .zip file was downloaded from the Download Center of the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, use the command:

```bash
npm install -g <path-to-mfpdev-cli.tgz>
```

- To install the CLI without optional dependencies add the `--no-optional` flag:  `npm install -g --no-optional path-to-mfpdev-cli.tgz`

To confirm the installation, run the command `mfpdev` without any arguments and it will print the help text:

NAME
     IBM MobileFirst Foundation Command Line Interface (CLI).

SYNOPSIS
     mfpdev <command> [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The IBM MobileFirst Foundation Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command-line
     for developing MobileFirst applications. The command-line can be used by itself, or in conjunction
     with the IBM MobileFirst Foundation Operations Console. Some functions are available from  
     the command-line only and not the console.

     For more information and a step-by-step example of using the CLI, see the IBM Knowledge Center for
     your version of IBM MobileFirst Foundation at

## Interactive and Direct modes
{: #interactive-and-direct-modes }
All commands can be executed in **interactive** or **direct mode**. In the interactive mode, the parameters required for the command will be prompted and some default values will be used. In direct mode, the parameters must be provided with the command being executed.

Example:

`mfpdev server add` in interactive mode:

```bash
? Enter the name of the new server definition: mydevserver
? Enter the fully qualified URL of this server: http://mydevserver.example.com:9080
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administrator login ID: admin
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administrator password: *****
? Save the admin password for this server?: Yes
? Enter the context root of the MobileFirst administration services: mfpadmin
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} connection timeout in seconds: 30
Verifying server configuration...
The following runtimes are currently installed on this server: mfp
Server profile 'mydevserver' added successfully.
```
The same command in direct mode would be

```bash
mfpdev server add mydevserver --url http://mydevserver.example.com:9080 --login admin --password admin --setdefault
```

To find what is the right syntax for a command in direct mode use `mfpdev help <command>`.


## Managing {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instances
{: #managing-mobilefirst-server-instances }
You can use `mfpdev server <option>` command to manage the instances of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} that are in use. There must be always at least one server instance listed as the default instance.   The default server is always used if another one was not specified.

### List server instances
{: #list-server-instances }
To list all the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instances available to be used, run the command:

```bash
mfpdev server info
```

By default, a local server profile is created automatically and used as the current default by the CLI.

### Add a new server instance
{: #add-a-new-server-instance }
If you are using another local or remote {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instance you can add it to the list of instances available to be used with the command:

```bash
mfpdev server add
```

Follow the interactive prompt to provide a name to the server, the server URL and user/password credentials.  
For example, to add a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} that is running on a Mobile Foundation IBM Cloud service you would do the following:

```bash
$ mfpdev server add
? Enter the name of the new server profile: MyBluemixServer
? Enter the fully qualified URL of this server: https://mobilefoundation-7abcd-server.mybluemix.net:443
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administrator login ID: admin
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} administrator password: *****
? Save the administrator password for this server?: Yes
? Enter the context root of the MobileFirst administration services: mfpadmin
? Enter the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} connection timeout in seconds: 30
? Make this server the default?: Yes
Verifying server configuration...
The following runtimes are currently installed on this server: mfp
Server profile 'MyBluemixServer' added successfully.
```

- Replace the "fully qualified URL of this server" with your own.

### Edit server instances
{: #edit-server-instances }
If you want to edit the details of a registered server instance, run the following command and follow the interactive prompt to select the server to be edited and provide the information to be updated.

```bash
mfpdev server edit
```

To set a server as the default one, use:

```bash
mfpdev server edit <server_name> --setdefault
```

### Remove server instances
{: #remove-server-instances }
To remove a server instance from the list of registered servers, run the command:

```bash
mfpdev server remove
```

And select the server from the interactive list

### Open {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}
{: #open-mobilefirst-operations-console }
To open the console of the default server registered run the command:

```bash
mfpdev server console
```

To open the console of another server, inform the server name as a parameter of the command:

```bash
mfpdev server console <server_name>
```

### Remove apps and adapters from a server
{: #remove-apps-and-adapters-from-a-server }
To remove all apps and adapters registered in a server run the command:

```bash
mfpdev server clean
```

And select the server to clean form the interactive prompt.  
This will put the server instance in a clean state without any app or adapter deployed.

## Managing applications
{: #managing-applications }
The command `mfpdev app <option>` can be used to manage applications created with the {{ site.data.keys.product }} SDK.

### Register an application in a server instance
{: #register-an-application-in-a-server-instance }
An  application must be registered in a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} when it is ready to be executed.  
To register an app, run the following command from the root folder of the app project:

```bash
mfpdev app register
```

This command can be executed from the root of a Cordova, Android, iOS or Windows application.  
It will use the default server and runtime to run the following tasks:

* Register an application with a server.
* Generate a default client properties file for the application.
* Put the server information into the client properties file.

For a Cordova application, this command will update the config.xml file.  
For an iOS application, this command will update the mfpclient.plist file.  
For an Android or Windows application, this command will update the mfpclient.properties file.

To register an app to a server and runtime that is not the default one, use the syntax:

```
mfpdev app register <server> <runtime>
```

For Cordova Windows platform, the `-w <platform>` argument must be added to the command.  The `<platform>` argument is a comma separated list of the windows platforms to be registered. Valid values are `windows`,`windows8` and `windowsphone8`.

```
mfpdev app register -w windows8
```

### Configure an application
{: #configure-an-application }
When an application is registered, server related attributes are added to its configuration file.  
To change the values of these attributes, run the following command:

```bash
mfpdev app config
```

This command will interactively present a list of attributes that can be changed, and prompt for the new value of the attribute.  
The attributes available will vary for each platform (iOS, Android, Windows).

Available configurations are:

* The server address and runtime the application will be registered to

    > **Example use case:** in order to register an application to a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with a certain address, but also have the application connect to a different server address, for example a DataPower appliance:
    >
    > 1. Run `mfpdev app register` to register the application in the expected {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} address.
    > 2. Run `mfpdev app config` and change the **server** property's value to match the address of the DataPower appliance. You can also run the command in **direct mode**: `mfpdev app config server http(s)://server-ip-or-host:port`.

* Setting a public key for the Direct Update authenticity feature
* Setting application default language (default is English (en))
* Whether or not to enable the web resources checksum test
* What file extensions to ignore during the web resources checksum test

### Preview a Cordova application
{: #preview-a-cordova-application }
A Cordova application's web resources can be previewed using a browser. Previewing an application allows for fast and rapid develop without needing to use native platform specific emulators and simulators.

Before running the preview command, you must prepare the project by adding the `wlInitOptions` variable. Complete the following steps:

1. Add the *wlInitOptions* variable to your main JavaScript file, which is **index.js** in a standard Cordova app.

   ```javascript
   var wlInitOptions = {
      mfpContextRoot:'/mfp', // "mfp" is the default context root of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}
      applicationId:'com.sample.app' // Replace with your own value.
   };
   ```

2. Register the app again by using the following command:

   ```bash
   mfpdev app register
   ```

 3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    cordova prepare
    ```

 4. Preview the Cordova application by running the following command from the Cordova application root folder:

    ```bash
    mfpdev app preview
    ```

You will be prompted to select which platform to preview and which type of preview to use.
There are two options of preview: MBS and Browser.

* MBS - {{ site.data.keys.mf_mbs }}. This method simulates a mobile device in a browser, as well as provide rudimentary Cordova API simulation such as Camera, File Upload, Geolocation and more. Note: You cannot use the cordova-browser with the MBS option.
* Browser - Simple Browser Rendering. This method presents the www resources of the Cordova application as a usual browser web page.

> For more details about the preview options see the [Cordova development tutorial](../cordova-apps).

### Update web resources for Direct Update
{: #update-web-resources-for-direct-update }
The web resources of a cordova app, like .html, .css and .js files inside **www** folder can be updated without the need to reinstall the app at the mobile device. This is possible with the Direct Update feature provided by {{ site.data.keys.product }}.

> For more details about how Direct Update works see the tutorial [Using Direct Update in Cordova applications](../direct-update).

When you want to send a new set of web resources to be updated in a cordova application, run the command

```bash
mfpdev app webupdate
```

This command will package the updated web resources to a .zip file and upload it to the default {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} registered. The packaged web resources can be found at the **[cordova-project-root-folder]/mobilefirst/** folder.

To upload the web resources to different server instance, inform the server name and runtime as part of the command

```bash
mfpdev app webupdate <server_name> <runtime>
```

You can use the --build parameter to generate the .zip file with the packaged web resources without uploading it to a server.

```bash
mfpdev app webupdate --build
```

To upload a package that was previously built, use the --file parameter

```bash
mfpdev app webupdate --file mobilefirst/com.ibm.test-android-1.0.0.zip
```

There is also the option to encrypt the content of package using the --encrypt parameter

```bash
mfpdev app webupdate --encrypt
```

### Pull and Push the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Application configuration
{: #pull-and-push-the-mobilefirst-application-configuration }
After a {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} Application is registered in a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}, it is possible to change some of the application configurations using the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} Console and them pull those configurations from the server to the application with the following command:

```bash
mfpdev app pull
```

It is also possible to change the application configurations locally and push the changes to the {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} with the command:

```bash
mfpdev app push
```

**Example:** scope mapping to security checks can be performed in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_console }}, and then be pulled from  the server using the abve command. The downloaded .zip file is stored in the project's **[root directory]/mobilefirst** folder, and can be later used with the `mfpdev app push` to upload it to a different {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}, allowing for fast configuration and setup by re-using the predefined configuration.

## Managing and Testing Adapters
{: #managing-and-testing-adapters }
It is possible to manage adapters with the command `mfpdev adapter <option>`.

> To learn more about adapters see the tutorials at the [Adapters](../../adapters/) category.


### Create an Adapter
{: #create-an-adapter }
To create a new Adapter, use the command

```bash
mfpdev adapter create
```

And follow the prompt to inform the name, type and group id of the adapter

### Build an Adapter
{: #build-an-adpater }
To build an adapter, run the following command from the adapter's root folder:

```bash
mfpdev adapter build
```

This will generate a .adapter file at the **<AdapterName>/target** folder.

### Deploy an Adapter
{: #deploy-an-adapter}
The following command will deploy the adapter to the default server:

```bash
mfpdev adapter deploy
```

To deploy to a different server, use:

```bash
mfpdev adapter deploy <server_name>
```

### Call an Adapter from the command line
{: #call-an-adapter-from-the-command-line }
After an adapter is deployed it is possible to call the adapter from the command line to test it's behavior with the command:

```bash
mfpdev adapter call
```

You will be prompted to inform the adapter, procedure and parameters to use. The output of the command will be the response of the adapter procedure.

> Learn more in the [Testing and debugging adapters](../../adapters/testing-and-debugging-adapters/) tutorial.

## Helpful commands
{: #helpful-commands }
To set preferences of the mfpdev CLI, such as default browser and default preview mode, use the command:

```bash
mfpdev config
```

To see the help content describing all mfpdev commands, use:

```bash
mfpdev help
```

The following command will generate a list with information about your environment:

```bash
