### Overview
{: #overview }
The {{ site.data.keys.product }} client SDKs provide a set of API methods that enable developers to implement various {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} features, such as: authentication and security mechanisms, Push and SMS notifications, resource requests, collection of analytics data, and lots more.

You can develop **mobile or Desktop web applications** by using your preferred development environment and tools, and add {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} features and capabilities to your client application as well as support for analytics data gathering

To create **Cordova apps** that are enabled for {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} features, you use your preferred development tools that support Cordova such as the Apache Cordova CLI or Ionic and others. You obtain some software, such as plug-ins, code to support various target platforms, command-line tools, or an IDE directly from the supplier of your development tools. Then, to use {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} capabilities, such as back-end services of {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }}, you add Cordova plug-ins that support {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} features to your app. These plug-ins are included in the {{ site.data.keys.mf_dev_kit_full }}. You can also download these plug-ins from npm.

To develop **native iOS/Android/Windows applications**, you must add the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} framework files to your Xcode/Android Studio/Visual Studio project.
