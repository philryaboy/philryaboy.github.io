## REST APIs
{: #rest-apis }
You can use the Push Service REST APIs to work with notifications.

* Use [Administration service REST API](../../api/rest/admin-apis) for adapters and applications.
* Use [Push service REST API](../../api/rest/push-service) to access Push functions from a REST API endpoint.

## Swagger
{: #swagger }
In the development environment provided by the [DevKit Installer](../../installation-configuration/development/mobilefirst) you can also access the Push REST APIs from a Swagger UI. To access it, load the following URL: [http://localhost:9080/doc/?url=/imfpush/v1/swagger.json](http://localhost:9080/doc/?url=/imfpush/v1/swagger.json).
