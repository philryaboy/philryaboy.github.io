## Overview
{: #overview }
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions to set up a {{ site.data.keys.mfound_server }} instance on IBM Cloud by using the {{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_full }} (**{{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }}**) service.  
{{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }} is a IBM Cloud service that enables quick and easy stand-up of scalable Developer or Production environments of Mobile Foundation v8.0 on **Liberty for Java runtime**.

The {{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }} service offers the following plan options:

1. **Developer**: This plan provisions a {{ site.data.keys.mfound_server }} as a Cloud Foundry application on a Liberty for Java runtime. Liberty for Java charges are billed separately and are not included in this plan. The plan does not support the use of external databases and is restricted to development and testing. The {{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }} server *Developer plan* instance allows you to register any number of Mobile applications for development and testing, but it restricts the number of connected devices to 10 per day. This plan also includes {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_service }} service instance. If your usage exceeds the Mobile Analytics free tier entitlements, then charges apply as per Mobile Analytics basic plan.

    > **Note:** the Developer plan does not offer a persistent database, as such be sure to backup your configuration as explained [in the Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

2. **Professional Per Device**: This plan allows users to build, test and run mobile applications in production. You are billed based on the number of client devices connected per day. This plan supports large deployments and high availability. This plan requires you to have an instance of IBM Db2 on Cloud (now called Db2 Hosted) service, which is created and billed separately. This plan provisions a Mobile Foundation server on Liberty for Java, starting with a minimum of 2 nodes of 1 GB. Liberty for Java charges are billed separately and are not included as part of this plan. Optionally, you can add  Mobile Analytics service instance. The Mobile Analytics service is billed separately.

3. **Professional 1 Application**: This plan allows users to build and manage a single mobile application with a predictable price, regardless of the number of mobile app users or devices. The single mobile application can be of multiple flavors, such as iOS, Android, Windows and Mobile Web. This plan provisions a Mobile Foundation server in a scalable environment as a Cloud Foundry application on Liberty for Java starting with a minimum of 2 nodes of 1 GB. Liberty for Java charges are billed separately and are not included as part of this plan. This plan also requires an IBM Db2 on Cloud (Db2 Hosted) service instance, which is created and billed separately. Optionally, you can add {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_service }} service instance by clicking the **Add Analytics** button. The Mobile Analytics service is billed separately.

4. **Developer Pro**: This plan provisions a {{ site.data.keys.mfound_server }} as a Cloud Foundry app on a Liberty for Java runtime, and allows users to develop and test any number of mobile applications. This plan requires you to have a **Db2 Hosted** service instance. The Db2 on Cloud service instance is created and billed separately. This plan is limited in size and is intended to be used for team-based development and testing activities, not production. Charges depend on the total size of your environment. Optionally, you can add a {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_service }} service by clicking the **Add Analytics** button.
>_The **Developer Pro** plan is now deprecated._

5. **Professional Per Capacity:** This plan allows users to build, test and run any number of mobile applications in production, regardless of the number of mobile users or devices. It supports large deployments and High Availability. The plan requires you to have a **Db2 Hosted** service instance. The Db2 Hosted service instance is created and billed separately. Charges depend on the total size of your environment. Optionally, you can add a {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_service }} service by clicking the **Add Analytics** button.
>_The **Professional Per Capacity** plan is now deprecated._

## Accessing server logs
{: #accessing-server-logs }
To access server logs, follow the steps described below.

**Scenario 1:**

1. Set up your host machine.<br/>
   To manage the IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry app, you need to install the Cloud Foundry CLI.<br/>
   Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).
2. Open the terminal and log in to your *Organization* and *Space* using `cf login`.
3. Execute the following command in the CLI:
```bash
  cf ssh <mfp_Appname> -c "/bin/cat logs/messages.log" > messages.log
```
4. Only if trace is enabled, execute the following command:
```bash
cf ssh <mfp_Appname> -c "/bin/cat logs/trace.log" > trace.log
 ```

**Scenario 2:**      

* To access server logs, open the sidebar navigation and click on **Apps → Dashboard → Cloud Foundry Apps**.
* Select your App and click on **Logs → View in Kibana**.
* Select and copy the logs messages.


#### Tracing
{: #tracing }
To enable tracing, in order to view DEBUG-level messages in the **trace.log** file:

1. In **Runtime → SSH**, select your service instance from the combobox (instance IDs start with **0**).
2. Go to each instance in the console and open the file `/home/vcap/app/wlp/usr/servers/mfp/configDropins/overrides/tracespec.xml` using the vi editor.
3. Update the following trace statement: `traceSpecification="=info:com.ibm.mfp.*=all"` and save the file.

The **trace.log** file is now available in the above specified location.

## Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting }
The Developer plan does not offer a persistent database, which could cause at times loss of data. To quickly onboard in such cases, be sure to follow these best practices:

* Every time you make any of the following server-side actions:
    * Deploy an adapter or update any adapter configuration or property value
    * Perform any security configuration such scope-mapping and alike

    Run the following from the command-line to download your configuration to a .zip file:

  ```bash
  $curl -X GET -u admin:admin -o export.zip http://<App Name>.mybluemix.net/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/export/all
  ```

* In case you recreate your server or lose your configuration, run the following from the command-line to import the configuration to the server:

  ```bash
  $curl -X POST -u admin:admin -F file=@./export.zip http://<App Name>.mybluemix.net/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/deploy/multi
  ```
