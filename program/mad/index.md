# Models, Agile and DevOps: MAD@MODELS'18
## Monday Afternoon, October, 15th 2018, 14:00-17:00
## DevOps and agile goes hand in hand – where does modeling fit?

There is Model Driven Development (MDD), there is Agile Development, and now DevOps is all the rage.  These methodologies certainly warrant discussions individually. Many might suggest that it’s hard to adopt all of them while still recognizing the value if it were possible to meet their business needs. Architecture modeling with an agile development methodology could be the key to managing ever changing business requirements.  Ensuring models are integrated into continuous build might streamline your DevOps pipeline. Modeling for your agile distributed teams helps them respond to problems ultimately delivering DevOps solutions through Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment.  The goal of MAD@MODELS’18 is to bring together IT professionals and swap ideas and strategies on how to truly accomplish an integrated DevOps pipeline using models on agile teams. Yes, let’s hear about and share successes and failures toward having MDD in an Agile team doing Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment.

MAD@MODELS is a new event that will continue to evolve at future Models conferences. If you have a suggested topic that you would like to cover please reach out to [Kimi Cousins](mailto:Kimi.Cousins@hcl.com).

## Registration

Since the MAD@MODELS meeting is fully part of MODELS'18, participants will have to register through the MODELS registration system.

## Speakers

* Modeling, Agile and DevOps – three words combined that can’t make sense! Michael Hudson (HCL)
* MAD in Your Organization: Thomas Wiman (Adocus AB)
* MAD is the possible: Ton Janssen (Oce)
* Large Teams going MAD: Roger Holmberg (Ericsson), Olivera Milenkovic (Aspire Technology)

We expect a very interactive session with input from all participants. If you have experiences in the DevOps and Agile combined with modelling that you would like to share you should be at this session. If you are interested in how modeling can be successfully integrated into an Agile development team and DevOps pipeline you should be at this session.
