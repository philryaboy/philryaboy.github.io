# Combined Call for Contributions to Satellite Events of MoDELS 2018

MODELS 2018: ACM/IEEE 21st International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems

October 14-19, 2018, Copenhagen, Denmark

[http://www.modelsconference.org](http://www.modelsconference.org)



MoDELS is the premier conference series for model-driven software and
systems engineering. Since 1998, MoDELS has covered all aspects of 
modeling, from languages and methods, to tools and applications. 
Attendees of MoDELS come from diverse backgrounds, including researchers, 
academics, engineers and industrial professionals. 

Now, we are calling for contributions to the satellite events of
MoDELS 2018, in particular, the Tools and Demonstrations session, the 
Posters session, the ACM Student Research Competition, the Doctoral and 
Educators Symposia, and the 17 Workshops that are co-located with 
MoDELS this year.
