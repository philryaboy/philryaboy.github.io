# Call for Tools and Demonstrations

MODELS is the premier conference series for model-based software and systems engineering, which since 1998 has been covering all aspects of modeling, from languages and methods to tools and applications. Since the inception of MODELS, the development of tools to support modeling activities has been an integral part of the research activities with many of these tools evolving into modeling platforms that support the development of new tools. 
The demonstration of tools at recent MODELS conferences has shown that researchers and practitioners are dedicating more time and effort to develop tools of a high quality to be used by the community. We would like to solicit high-quality submissions for the tool demonstration track ranging across commercial, academic, and corporate research and industrial systems. We encourage submissions on tools that are: research prototypes built to support novel research ideas, tools to support pedagogy, extensions of existing tools and tool chains, and mature tools not yet commercialized. 
The submissions to this track should not have been demonstrated at other venues and extensions of existing tools should be substantial. Based on the purpose of the tool, submissions will be evaluated on their technical merit, novelty, pedagogical impact, relevance to the modeling community and level of maturity. At least one of the authors must attend the demonstration session in order to present and discuss their tool with attendees.

We will also be inviting "lightning demos" as a second opportunity to run a tool demo at the conference. Proposals for these can come in as late as during the week of the conference. For this category of demos, no official submission is required and no publication will be made. These will also be open to researchers and practitioners who cannot physically attend the conference. Detailed instructions for the submission of lightning demos are provided [here](lightning-tool-demos.html).

## Important Dates
All submission deadlines are AoE (i.e. UTC-12).
* July 20, 2018, Abstract 
* July 31, 2018, Full submission (extended)
* August 17, 2018, Acceptance notification
* August 24, 2018, Camera ready
* October 18-19, 2018, Demo sessions

## Submission Guidelines
A short abstract describing the tool and demonstration must be submitted via EasyChair by July 20, 2018. 
Full submissions must be submitted via EasyChair by July 27, 2018. Submissions must adhere to the sigconf format provided by ACM (see [template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) for details). 
A full submission must consist of no more than 5 pages describing the tool presented. Authors must highlight the novelty of their tool and position it with respect to related work on existing tools. The paper must include a link to a 3-5 minute-long online (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo) video that demonstrates the use of the tool.
Submissions that do not adhere to the above specified page limits or that violate the formatting guidelines may be desk-rejected without review.
Please submit your paper electronically in PDF via Easychair at the following URL:  [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=models2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=models2018) ("Tools and Demos" track)

## Publication
Accepted tool demonstration papers will be published in ACM Digital Library and indexed by DBLP. A best demonstration award will be given during the conference.
