# Call for Lightning Tool Demonstrations

This is an opportunity to deliver a tool demo at MODELS even if you have missed the main deadline of the [tools and demos track](index.html), or you cannot physically attend the conference. 

For this category of demos, no official paper submission is required and no publication will be made. To apply for a 10-minute slot, please send an email with a brief description of the demo and links to any relevant resources (e.g. tool website, articles, papers) to Dimitris Kolovos ([dimitris.kolovos@york.ac.uk](mailto:dimitris.kolovos@york.ac.uk)).

The deadline for submitting lightning tool demo proposals is October 17 (AoE) and demos will be delivered during the following slots (please let us know if you have a preference)

* October 19, 2018
  * Session: 10:00 - 11:00
  * Lightning demos: 11:00 - 11:30

If you cannot attend the conference, please send us a recorded demo of your tool (with voice) and we will project it during one of the tool demo sessions.
