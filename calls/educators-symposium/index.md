# Call for Educators Symposium

In today’s technological environment, models play a major role in understanding business needs, in requirements elicitation, and in software development. To facilitate these activities, in the past decades many modeling languages such as URN (for requirements), BPMN (for business process modeling) and the UML (for software development) were introduced both in the academia and in practice. Although the use of these models and modeling languages is gaining some traction in industry, their use is still limited. Arguably, a contributory factor limiting the use of modeling is the lack of appropriate educational resources.
The 14th Educators Symposium at MODELS 2018 provides educators, researchers and practitioners a forum to discuss approaches to better address the issues facing the appropriate use of models and related technologies in the classroom. We invite submissions related to (but not limited to) the following questions and topics:

* Challenges in teaching modeling:
    * How to engage students into modeling?
    * How to integrate modeling across the curriculum, from introduction to programming to senior project and beyond?
    * What appropriate and novel modeling technologies are currently used to enrich the student experience?
    * How best to mix theory and practice when teaching modeling?
    * What is the relationship of modeling and theory?
    * How to exploit effective learning and teaching mechanisms for distance and online learning?
    * How to teach modeling in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)?
    * Is teaching modeling using a collaborative approach feasible?

* Are there online tools to support the teaching of modeling?
* Research methods in modeling education
* Practitioner viewpoint on modeling education
* Use of case studies or explicative examples to teach modeling
* Teaching global or open source software engineering modeling
* Informal teaching of modeling
* Evolution of teaching modeling and use of tools in the classroom

## Submission Guidelines 

Papers have to present original content. Previously published papers, accepted papers or under review for other publications are not eligible for submission to the Educators Symposium 2018. The format for the ACM volumes has to be the sigconf template provided by ACM (see https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template for details).
 * Full Papers are expected to contribute research and experience reports and must be no longer than 8 pages.
 * Short Papers are expected to present position statements addressing the symposium’s topics. These papers intend to stimulate discussions on teaching modeling at universities and in industry and must not exceed 5 pages.

All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format via Easychair at: [Workshop Educators Sympoisum Link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edusymp2018)

## Publication
All papers of the **14th Educators Symposium at MODELS 2018** will be published in a companion proceedings volume at ACM. At least one author for each accepted paper must register for the symposium at the MODELS 2018 conference by the early registration deadline and present the paper at the symposium. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.
All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The paper selection process will be based on the novelty of the ideas or solutions, the impact of modeling in software development education, and relevance to the topics of the symposium.

## Important Dates
All submission deadlines are AoE (i.e. UTC-12).

* July 20, 2018: Abstract submission
* July 27, 2018: Paper submission
* August 17, 2018: Acceptance Notification
* August 24, 2018: Camera Ready
* TBD: Educators Symposium

## Organizers

* Martin Gogolla, University of Bremen, Germany
* Loli Burgueño, University of Málaga, Spain
