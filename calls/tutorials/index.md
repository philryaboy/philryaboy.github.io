# Call for Tutorials

Following the tradition of previous conferences, MODELS 2018 will host tutorials as part of its satellite events on October 14 to 16, 2018.

Tutorials provide intensive courses on topics in the area of model-based software and systems engineering ranging from modeling methodologies and research methods through new modeling tools and technologies to thoughts on the past, current, and future development of the modeling discipline.

## Important Dates

* Tutorial proposal submission: March 16, 2018 Anywhere on Earth (i.e. UTC-12)

* Notification: April 13, 2018

* Tutorials: October 14-16, 2018


## Audience


Tutorials target an audience of practitioners, researchers (academic and industrial), students, and developers familiar with, and already working with, modeling techniques. The target audience typically has a strong interest in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), including work on improving and evolving modeling languages (such as UML or DSLs), developing sophisticated MDE tool support, and using MDE to develop / test / reverse / maintain complex systems. Potential attendees may also be interested in how modeling has been applied effectively in specialized domains (e.g., in the automotive industry), and in learning about successful uses of MDE methods in real-world applications.

## Topics

The following themes are examples of what is considered relevant for tutorials:

 Modeling techniques for specific domains (e.g., automobile, cyber-physical and hybrid systems, …)

* Modeling methodologies and model-oriented processes (e.g., for agile modelling or modelling at scale)

* AI in modelling (including search*based approaches, machine learning, planning, or flexible modelling)

* Presentation of new tools or new versions of old tools (e.g., modeling tools, language workbenches, model transformation languages, model verification tools, model execution tools)

* Dissemination of project results from industry-related projects

* Teaching of model-driven software development

* Research methods in MD* (Model-Driven Development (MDD), Model Driven Engineering (MDE), Model Driven Software Development (MDSD), etc.)

* Modeling for re-engineering and legacy evolution

* Empirical studies in the context of modeling

* User experience in model-based software engineering

* Practical experiences of general interest

* General topics of interest to young researchers, like presentation skills or research methodologies

Tutorials are intended to provide independent instructions on a topic of relevance to the audience described above. Therefore, no sales-oriented presentations will be accepted. Tutorials relating to commercial tools or involving the use of commercial tools may be accepted, but will be subject to closer scrutiny, including possible approval of presentation slides. Potential presenters should keep in mind that there may be quite a varied audience, including novice graduate students, seasoned practitioners, and specialized researchers. Tutorial speakers should be prepared to cope with this diversity.

## Proposal Contents

All submissions must be in English and adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions (https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). The submission must include the following information in the indicated order:

* Title

* Presenters: Name, affiliation, contact information, and short bio.

    Authors of the proposal or tutorial material, who are not going to be presenting, may be listed, but must be listed last with a footnote “Author only; will not be presenting”.

* Abstract (maximum of 200 words)

    If accepted, the abstract will be used to advertise the tutorial. Thus, the abstract should clearly highlight the goals of the tutorial and the skills that participants will acquire.

* Keywords (at least 5 keywords)

* Proposed length: half-day (3 hours) or full-day (6 hours)

    Regular tutorials should be set up as half-day tutorials (3 hours). A proposal for a full-day tutorial (6 hours) must be accompanied by a clear justification of why 6 hours are necessary.

* Level of the tutorial: beginner/introduction or advanced

* Target audience and any prerequisite background required by attendees to be able to follow the tutorial (beyond average modeling skills)

* Description of the tutorial and intended outline (maximum of 4 pages)

* Novelty of the tutorial

    List offerings of similar tutorials at previous editions of the MODELS conference or other conferences, and discuss the differences with respect to the current proposal.

* Required infrastructure

    Declare any infrastructure that you would need for your tutorial besides a data projector (e.g., flip charts, white boards). We will do our best together with the local organizers to provide you with the needed infrastructure.

* Sample slides (minimum of 6 slides, maximum of 25 slides)

* Supplementary material (optional)

## Submission Guidelines

Proposals must be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [MODELS 2018 Tutorials EasyChair submission page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=models2018) - select category “Tutorials”, by March 16, 2018 AoE.

This is a hard deadline. No extensions will be allowed.

## Review Process

The Tutorials Selection Committee will review each submitted proposal to ensure high quality, and select tutorials based on their anticipated benefit for prospective participants and their fit within the tutorial program as a whole. Factors to be considered also include: relevance, timeliness, importance, and audience appeal; effectiveness of teaching methods; and past experience and qualifications of the instructors. The goal will be to provide a diverse set of tutorials that attracts a high level of interest among broad segments of the MODELS participants.

## Compensation

As in previous years, participants will pay a single satellite fee, which will cover both tutorials and workshops. This permits unifying the treatment of workshops and tutorials, and it makes tutorials more attractive to attendees. Under this scheme, tutorial presenters will not receive monetary compensation, and will have to pay their own registration to the satellite events. By submitting a tutorial proposal, the presenter accepts that there will be no compensation for giving the tutorial if accepted and that the registration fees for the instructors have to be funded by the instructors themselves. The benefit to the presenter is the opportunity to extend their sphere of influence to the MODELS community.
