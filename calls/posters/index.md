# Call for Posters

The MODELS 2018 posters track provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present, demonstrate, and discuss their most recent achievements, practical experiences, novel ideas, tools, and challenges related to model-based software and systems engineering. As premier conference in this area, MODELS provides an excellent environment for discussing recent results, receiving feedback and making new contacts within the model-based software and systems engineering community.

The goal of the poster track is to encourage and facilitate the exchange within the MODELS community, foster collaboration, and, therewith strengthen the community as a whole. 

## Topics
Posters are expected to stimulate discussions of recent advances, practical experiences, new ideas, tools, and challenges in the field of model-based software and systems engineering. We also welcome posters presenting early work, visions for the future, current initiatives, and work on modeling education. For a list of topics relevant to MODELS, we refer to the [call for papers](https://modelsconf2018.github.io/calls/call) of the main conference track.

## Poster Submissions
This year, we distinguish two types of poster submissions: stand-alone poster submissions and paper-accompanying poster submissions.
### Stand-Alone Poster Submissions
 Stand-alone poster submissions are poster submissions that present a novel contribution in the field of model-based software and systems engineering and are independent of any paper accepted at the MODELS 2018 main track or submitted to any of the MODELS 2018 satellite events. 

Such submissions consist of two parts:

1. An extended abstract of the presented contribution comprising the following contents:
* Title
* Author(s) and affiliation(s)
* Motivation and goals
* Background information if needed to understand the contribution
* Adequate detail on the contribution
* Related work
* Links to additional information (e.g., project Website, source code repository, demo material, etc.)

2. A draft of the actual poster comprising the contents given above for the extended abstracts.

The extended abstracts have to adhere to the [ACM sigconf formatting instructions](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and are restricted to two pages.

The posters have to be in A1 portrait format (594mm x 841mm). The article [Research posters 101](https://doi.org/10.1145/332132.332138) by Lorrie Faith Cranor published in ACM Crossroads provides excellent tips on how to prepare successful posters.

Both, the extended abstract and the poster have to be written in English and submitted in PDF format.

### Paper-Accompanying Poster Submissions
Paper-accompanying poster submissions are poster submissions that are directly related to a paper accepted at the MODELS 2018 main track or any of the MODELS 2018 satellite events. The aim of such poster submissions is to further disseminate the contribution presented in the respective paper, to receive additional feedback and further discuss the presented work.

This kind of poster submissions consist only of a draft of the poster to be presented at the MODELS poster track. An extended abstract is not required. The poster should contain the content given above for stand-alone poster submissions, and follow the same format restrictions.

## Submission Guidelines
All poster submissions have to be submitted electronically in PDF format at the MODELS 2018 Poster track submission page: [Posters Submission Link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=models2018)

For stand-alone poster submissions, the extended abstract and the poster have to be submitted in individual PDF files.

For paper-accompanying poster submissions, the poster and the corresponding paper have to be submitted in individual PDF files.

For both types of submissions, a short abstract summarizing the contributions of the poster and at least three keywords have to be provided at the submission page.

## Reviewing Process
The main evaluation criteria for stand-alone poster submissions are the quality of the proposed posters in terms of originality, relevance for the MODELS audience, technical soundness, and presentation quality. Each stand-alone poster submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the poster selection committee.

The main evaluation criterion for paper-accompanying poster submissions is presentation quality.

## Publication
The extended abstracts of accepted stand-alone poster submissions will be published in an ACM volume. The actual posters will not be published.

Accepted paper-accompanying poster submissions will not be published.

## Poster Presentation
Accepted posters will be advertised in the conference program and displayed during the main conference.There will be a dedicated poster session at the conference welcome reception. At least one of the authors of each accepted poster must attend the poster session to present and discuss their work with attendees.
