# Call for Workshops
The MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences related to model-driven software engineering. Topics covered by MODELS include, among others, domain-specific modelling languages, general-purpose modelling languages and standards, model-driven engineering processes, model transformations, model-driven software engineering tools and frameworks, as well as quality assurance for functional and non-functional properties of models.

Following the tradition of previous conferences, MODELS 2018 will host a number of workshops during three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic related to model-driven software engineering, and to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussion of innovative ideas, recent progress, and practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects, problems or needs.

In 2018, MODELS challenges the community to explore the use of modelling for new and emerging systems, paradigms, and open problems, including (but not limited to):
*	cyber-physical and safety-critical systems
*	cloud computing
*	social media
*	security
*	open source
*	analytics
*	society and sustainability
*	games and gamification
*	human factors and accessibility

We encourage prospective workshop organizers to submit proposals for highly interactive workshops focusing on areas related to modelling in general. Both research-oriented and applied topics are welcome. The duration of each workshop is either half a day or a full day.

Workshops are typically based on presenting peer-reviewed papers submitted to the workshop. However, we also welcome workshops that do not intend to run a paper submission process, but take a different format.

## Important Dates
*	Workshop proposal submission: March 03, 2018 Anywhere on Earth (i.e. UTC-12)
*	Notification: April 13, 2018
*	Workshops: October 14-16, 2018 (Sunday to Tuesday).

## Workshop Proposal Guidelines
Your proposal must contain the following information:
General Information:
*	Workshop title and name or acronym
*	Organizers and primary contact (name/affiliation/email)
*	Desired length of the workshop (half day or full day)
*	Abstract (200 words), intended for the MODELS 2018 website
### Objectives and Scope:
*	Motivation
*	Objectives
*	Topics of interest
*	Intended audience
*	Relevance to the MODELS 2018 conference and the MODELS community in general (comments in favour of your application; whether the workshop was at MODELS 2017 or any earlier MODELS conference; an argument why it should be held again)
*	Information about the previous workshop editions, if applicable, including website, number of submitted and accepted papers, and number of participants
### Organization Details:
*	Details about the organizers (150 words max), including relevant experience in workshop organization
*	Workshop program committee (indicate whether already finalized or expected)
### Workshop Format:
*	Intended paper format, if applicable (number of pages and types of papers, e.g. full papers, work-in-progress papers, practitioners' reports, posters)
*	Evaluation process, if applicable
*	Intended workshop format (including duration, number of presentations, and planned keynotes)
*	Number of expected participants (please make at least an educated guess). Note: For workshops that have a different strategy for participant recruitment than paper submissions, explain how you plan to attract participants.
*	Specific requirements (e.g. equipment or room capacity)
### Additional Material:
*	If existent, URL of the workshop web page (or a draft of it)
*	Draft of the workshop’s Call for Papers (CfP) that you intend to send out if your workshop is accepted (around 1 page)

To ensure a proper coordination of the workshop paper submission deadlines with those of the main conference, the following constraints have to be respected:
*	Workshop website and CfP dissemination: May 10, 2018
*	Workshop paper submission deadline: July 17, 2018
*	Workshop paper notification to authors: August 17, 2018 (or before, but STRICTLY NOT LATER, since the notification should be before the MODELS early registration deadline)
*	Workshop paper camera ready version: August 21, 2018
*	Workshop dates: October 14-16, 2018

Please note that the dates above are common across all workshops.

## Submission Guidelines
Please ensure that you adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines above and  provide all of the requested information within at most 7 pages, including the CfP draft. Submissions must adhere to the ACM formatting instructions (specifically the sigconf template), which can be found at: 
[ACM Templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Please submit your workshop proposal electronically as a PDF via EasyChair at: [Workshop EasyChair submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=models2018)
until the workshop proposal deadline on March 03, 2018.

## Proceedings
As last year, there will be joint workshop proceedings that include papers from all workshops. The proceedings will be published by CEUR (http://ceur-ws.org).

For each workshop, the joint proceedings will include:
*	An opening message from the organizers, including, if applicable, the workshop program committee
*	All peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop (papers should have at least 5 pages in LNCS format, we propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers)
*	Abstracts of invited talks

Further details will be communicated to the organizers of accepted workshops at the time of notification.
